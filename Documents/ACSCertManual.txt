## FOREWORD

World vehicle manufacturers are currently required to meet international regulatory requirements to use lower global

warming potential (GWP) refrigerants in new vehicle A/C systems. This MACS Technician Training Program conforms to

and complies with the SAE International standard J2845, _“HFO-1234yf Technician Training for Service and Containment of_

_Refrigerants Used in Mobile A/C Systems.”_

Some of the practices, techniques, procedures, tools, information and equipment required to service HFO-1234yf and other

alternative refrigerant systems are different from those commonly used on CFC-12 and HFC-134a systems. No technician

should perform service or repair on a mobile air conditioning system without being trained to handle the refrigerant the

system contains.

While SAE standards are voluntary and developed through industry consensus, historically the U.S. Environmental

Protection Agency has incorporated SAE standards into federal regulations by reference. Additionally, some individual

states require compliance with SAE standards, particularly those related to safety. For example, many states refer to

SAE J639, “ _Safety Standards for Motor Vehicle Refrigerant Vapor Compression Systems”_ in various laws and regulations.

MACS Worldwide acknowledges and thanks the U.S. EPA, SAE International, and the industry’s many manufacturers and

suppliers who allowed their data and products to appear in this manual.

```
Standard J639: Safety Standards for Motor Vehicle
Refrigerant Vapor Compression Systems
Issuing Committee: SAE International Interior Climate Control Steering Committee
This SAE Standard applies to refrigerant vapor compression systems that provide cooling and/or heating for
passenger cars, light trucks and commercial vehicles (on and off road) that use automotive type mobile air con-
ditioning (MAC) systems. Large trucks, buses and other vehicles that do not use typical automotive A/C systems
or use refrigerants not listed in this document are not covered by this standard. This standard covers any vehicle
with a MAC system using a belt or electric motor driven compressor.
This document provides standards for design, assembly, test and service of MAC systems to minimize environ-
mental, health and safety impacts. Also included are cautionary statements for the service industry to alert
technicians to the inadvisability and possible health or safety effects associated with venting refrigerant during
service. This document addresses only HFC-134a (R-134a), carbon dioxide (R-744), and HFO-1234yf (R-1234yf)
refrigerants.
To prevent system contamination, all refrigerants used in mobile air conditioning vapor compression systems
require unique service fittings and service equipment. The unique service fittings are intended to eliminate the
potential for system refrigerant cross-contamination during service activity. CFC-12 (R-12) is no longer in use
in new MAC systems. The service fitting description is maintained as a reference for older vehicles still in use.
When retrofitting an R-12 system to use R-134a or when removing R-12 (vehicle disposal), use service equipment
designed for R-12 and certified to meet the requirements of SAE J1990 (R-12 recovery and recycle equipment).
HFC-152a is an A2 flammable refrigerant as classified by ASHRAE 34 and should be used only with a second-
ary loop application. However, until MAC systems are developed to use HFC-152a (R-152a), no SAE Standards for
system design, service equipment or service procedures have been established. The R-152a service fittings de-
scribed within this Standard were established as part of the industry’s evaluation of replacement refrigerants
and are maintained for future design guidance and to prevent potential refrigerant cross contamination.

## THE SWITCH TO CLIMATE-FRIENDLY REFRIGERANTS

### Introduction

Before the early 1990s, mobile air conditioning systems
used CFC-12 refrigerant, a substance that destroys the
stratospheric ozone layer that shields the earth from the
sun’s harmful ultraviolet radiation.

Automobile manufacturers replaced CFC-12 with HFC-
134a in the mid-1990s. HFC-134a is not an ozone deplet-
ing refrigerant, but like CFC-12, is a potent greenhouse
gas that contributes to climate change.

Today, automobile manufacturers are transitioning to
new, climate friendly alternative refrigerants.

EPA’s Significant New Alternatives Policy (SNAP) Program
identifies alternatives that pose lower overall risk to hu-
man health and the environment. Under SNAP, EPA has
listed three low global warming potential refrigerants
as acceptable for mobile air conditioning subject to use
conditions: hydrofluoroolefin (HFO)-1234yf, carbon di-
oxide, and HFC-152a. None of these alternatives deplete
the ozone layer and all have significantly lower impacts

to the climate system than CFC-12 or HFC-134a.

Global Warming and Climate Change

The term climate change is often used interchangeably
with the term global warming. Climate change is becom-
ing the preferred term because it points to many chang-
es, not just rising temperatures.

**Climate change** may result from:

natural factors, such as changes in the sun’s inten-
sity;
natural processes in the climate system, such as
ocean circulation, and
human activities that change the atmosphere’s com-
position; for example, burning fossil fuels, removing
large areas of forest or expansion of city areas.
**Global warming** is an increase in the average tempera-
ture of the atmosphere near the Earth’s surface and in
the upper atmosphere. In common usage, “global warm-
ing” often refers to the warming that can occur as a
result of increased emissions of greenhouse gases from
human activities.

**Greenhouse gases,** whether natural or man-made, re-
duce the amount of heat that can escape from the atmo-
sphere. If too much heat is retained, the effect is similar
to being in a garden greenhouse where the glass admits
sunlight but traps the heat within.

```
Some heat-trapping gases occur naturally in the atmo-
sphere: water vapor, carbon dioxide, methane, ozone
and others. Natural processes within the atmosphere
keep the gasses and the heat exchange in balance.
Man-made chemicals and emissions also affect the at-
mosphere, and many believe that the large volume re-
leased around the world is tipping the balance in the
atmosphere and increasing the amount of heat held near
the surface.
To describe how much effect each chemical may have
in the atmosphere, scientists developed a rating index
of “global warming potential” or GWP. It compares the
behavior of each chemical against carbon dioxide, a
chemical with very little effect and a GWP rating of 1.
Chemicals with a high GWP contribute more to the prob-
lem than products with a low number.

_The condensers used in HFC-134a systems are more efficient than the ones that were used in CFC-12 systems. The 3/8-inch tube-and-fin
condenser shown on the left diagram is an example of the type that was used for many years in CFC-12 systems. The parallel flow/multi-
flow condenser on the right diagram is representative of the type of condensers used in most HFC-134a systems._

### Servicing of Future Mobile Air Conditioning Systems

Concern about the environment has, and continues to
spur changes in the type and amount of refrigerant used
in mobile air conditioning systems. This has resulted
in system design updates, new service procedures and
equipment to reduce lifetime emissions.

The global automotive industry and the U.S. EPA have
evaluated new replacement refrigerants that will affect
the service of future systems.

In Europe

In 2006, the European Commission adopted stiff new
rules to control many sources of global warming. Vehicle
manufacturers are working now to reduce tailpipe emis-
sions, increase fuel mileage and change to an air condi-
tioning refrigerant with a GWP below 150.

```
By European law, certain new vehicles were required
to begin using a replacement refrigerant by 2013, and
HFC-134a has been eliminated from use in almost all
passenger vehicles since January 1, 2017. However, the
legal requirements do not specify the exact refrigerant
to be used — only that whatever is chosen must be less
damaging to the atmosphere.
```
```
In the U.S.
What Europe chose has had an effect in our country as
well. Vehicle makers around the world sell their products
in many countries. Also, switching to a low GWP refrig-
erant provides CAFE (Corporate Average Fuel Economy)
credits for vehicle manufacturers from the US EPA.
```
The Switch to HFC-134a Refrigerant

Starting with some 1992 models, and completed by the
1995 model year, HFC-134a replaced CFC-12 in vehicles
sold in the U.S. Changes in system designs were required
to assure that HFC-134a systems performed equal to CFC-
12 systems. Some of these changes included new hose
and seal materials compatible with HFC-134a, and the
lubricants used with it. New hose and seal designs also
reduced leakage.

```
The most noticeable changes however, were redesigned
condensers, which incorporated increased airflow to re-
duce system pressures at low speed operation and city
traffic conditions. In general, condenser performance
for HFC-134a systems increased by approximately 30%
over that of CFC-12 systems, which resulted in compa-
rable performance between the two refrigerants.
HFC-134a systems also required a new desiccant mate-
rial. Desiccant, which absorbs moisture in the system, is
located in the receiver/drier or accumulator, or integral
in a cartridge or bag with the condenser.

NOTES:

```
EPA is not requiring the use of HFO-1234yf or any
other alternative for MVAC systems. Automobile
manufacturers have the option of using any refrig-
erant listed as acceptable for this end-use, so long
as they meet any applicable use conditions.
```
HFO-1234yf Systems

The chemical HFO-1234yf and the motor vehicle air con-
ditioning (MVAC) systems using it are different from
CFC-12 and HFC-134a systems. Vehicles using the new
refrigerant require new service procedures and new shop
equipment. A technician will need the skills to recognize
the differences between refrigerants and how to service
or repair each one properly and safely.

The U.S. EPA has listed HFO-1234yf as “Acceptable, sub-
ject to use conditions, for use in newly manufactured
passenger cars, light-duty trucks, medium-duty passen-
ger vehicles, heavy-duty pickup trucks, and complete

heavy-duty vans.” EPA also noted, “This determination
does not apply to the use of HFO-1234yf as a conver-
sion or retrofit for existing MVAC systems. In addition, it
does not apply to the use of HFO-1234yf in the air con-
ditioning or refrigeration systems of heavy duty trucks,
refrigerated transport, or off-road vehicles such as agri-
cultural or construction equipment.”

The required conditions are that this refrigerant may
ONLY be used in new vehicles with components specifi-
cally designed for it. The new system designs will in-
clude some new components and materials.

The new chemical has other uses in other industries, but
when it is used as a refrigerant it is designated R-1234yf.
Chemically, it is a hydrofluoroolefin, and contains the el-
ements carbon, hydrogen and fluorine. Its full chemical
name is 2,3,3,3-Tetrafluoroprop-1-ene.

HFO-1234yf is classed by ASHRAE as A2L - Mildly Flam-
mable. It can ignite under certain circumstances. The
refrigerant HFO-1234yf is similar to, but not the same as,
HFC-134a. It has been developed and tested by its manu-
facturers, independent laboratories, vehicle manufactur-
ers, industry study groups and government agencies.

It has passed a variety of tests for human exposure risk
and toxicity, flammability, environmental damage and
suitability for use in vehicles. Various properties of this
chemical have been evaluated by SAE International,
U.S. EPA, JAMA (Japan), ASHRAE, and the European Alli-
ance. The chemical has been found acceptable for use by
many governments and regulating bodies, and is listed
on the U.S. EPA SNAP list of acceptable refrigerants,

```
the AIHA-WEEL list (American Industrial Hygiene Assn.
```
- Workplace Environmental Exposure Limit), and in the
European REACH program.
This chemical is NOT a “drop-in” refrigerant or one that
should be used in other systems. Systems designed for
HFO-1234yf should only be charged with that refriger-
ant. Systems designed for other refrigerants should only
use those correct products.
**See Best Service Practices for HFO-1234yf Systems,
beginning on page 42.**

```
R-744 (Carbon Dioxide) Systems
To meet the European low GWP refrigerant require-
ments, vehicle manufacturers have worked to develop
mobile air conditioning systems that use carbon diox-
ide (R-744) as a refrigerant. R-744 has the lowest GWP
value of new refrigerants being considered. Carbon di-
oxide systems will require different types of compo-
nents compared to HFC-134a systems. R-744 systems
operate at pressures 5 to 10 times higher than HFC-
134a and HFC-152a systems.
Carbon dioxide is hazardous, and therefore, also requires
system design features to address safety for vehicle oc-
cupants and service personnel. In addition, new service
equipment and service procedures, as well as specific
training, would be required for technicians servicing
R-744 systems.
```
```
Standard J2683: Refrigerant Purity and Container
Requirement for Carbon Dioxide (CO 2 /R-744) Used
in Mobile Air Conditioning Systems
Issuing Committee: SAE International Interior Climate
Control Fluids Committee
This SAE Standard applies to Carbon Dioxide R-744 re-
frigerant used to service motor vehicle passenger air
conditioning (A/C) systems designed to use CO 2 (R-
744). Carbon dioxide (R-744) when used as a refriger-
ant in mobile air conditioning systems shall contain
an odorant as an identification of refrigerant leaking
from the system. Hermetically sealed, refrigerated
cargo systems are not covered by this document.
```

HFC-152a Systems

HFC-152a is another refrigerant that meets the Euro-
pean Community’s requirements. HFC-152a has similar
operating pressures to HFC-134a. However, HFC-152a is
flammable, so its use would also require system design
features to address vehicle occupant and service person-
nel safety.

Two types of HFC-152a systems have so far been dem-
onstrated; the direct expansion type and the secondary
loop type.

The direct expansion type is just like an HFC-134a sys-
tem, except that to address the flammability issue, sys-
tem safety features are required. The secondary loop
type incorporates a direct expansion refrigerant circuit
located in the engine compartment with a chiller that
cools a non-flammable liquid. The non-flammable liquid
is circulated to a cooling coil that replaces the evapora-
tor. This provides isolation between the flammable re-
frigerant and the passenger compartment.

New service equipment, procedures, and training, would
be required for technicians servicing HFC-152a systems.

One of the lesser known refrigerants, R-152a can actu-
ally be found quite easily. Its chemical name is difluoro-
ethane, the propellant often used in asthma inhalers and
computer duster spray cans, amongst other uses. It’s also
a very effective and efficient refrigerant which has un-
dergone extensive practical study by some of the world’s
largest car makers and A/C system manufacturers.

The biggest drawback to using R-152a is its ASHRAE
flammability rating, which is A2. This means that it will

```
burn when ignited. Therefore, for safety reasons, proto-
type systems which are currently being developed use a
design called a Secondary Loop A/C system.
```
```
Other Alternative Refrigerants
Other chemicals being developed as replacement refriger-
ants with low GWP ratings may also enter the market-
place. The systems in which they are intended for use will
be specifically designed to use these new refrigerants.
```
```
CAUTION
Technicians working on mobile air conditioning sys-
tems should be keenly aware of the characteristics of
the refrigerants they are working with for their own
safety, and that of their co-workers and customers.
R-1234y f Sys tems : These systems are classified by
ASHRAE as A2L – Mildly Flammable. See pages 43
and 44 for specific safety procedures.
R-744 (Carbon Dioxide) Systems: These systems
operate at much higher pressures than R-134a or R-
1234yf systems. Also, if a system with this refrig-
erant is overcharged and a leak into the passenger
compartment occurs, the concentration could exceed
the health based limit for carbon dioxide (CO 2 ). Con-
centrations may not exceed a short term exposure
level of 3% or 30,000 parts per million (ppm) aver-
aged over 15 minutes in the passenger free space;
and the ceiling limit of 4% or 40,000 ppm in the
passenger breathing zone.
```
_Most A/C systems are Direct Expansion, meaning the refrigerant directly expands within the evaporator that’s located inside the pas-
senger compartment. For safety reasons, systems designed to use R-152a will be Secondary Loop, instead using a refrigerant-to-glycol
heat exchanger located inside the engine compartment. Chilled glycol will then circulate through a Cooler Core of sorts, to remove heat
from the cabin._

Section 609 of the Clean Air Act gives the EPA authority
to establish standards and requirements regarding the
servicing of mobile A/C systems.

Equipment Use

Since January 1, 1992, for CFC-12, and November 15, 1995
for HFC-134a and other mobile A/C refrigerants, any per-
son servicing the mobile air conditioning pressurized
refrigerant circuit must comply with the Clean Air Act
and must use either refrigerant recovery/recycling or
recovery-only equipment approved by EPA. Those work-
ing “for consideration” (receiving monetary value) who
open the refrigerant circuit must be certified by an EPA-
approved organization to legally use such equipment to
service the system.

Persons working on their own mobile air conditioning sys-
tem are not covered under this rule and can add refriger-
ant without being certified. It is illegal for any person to
knowingly release or vent refrigerants (except CO 2 ) during
service, maintenance, repair and disposal. Such actions
pose a risk to human health and the environment.

Fleets of vehicles, whether private, federal, state or lo-
cal government owned, are subject to the regulations
because the technicians performing the service are paid.
Other examples of establishments covered by the regu-
lations include, but are not limited to: independent re-
pair shops, service stations, fleet shops, collision repair

### Federal Regulations Affecting Mobile A/C System Service

```
Under Section 608 of the Clean Air
Act, intentional release (venting)
of any refrigerant is illegal unless
the refrigerant is specifically ex-
empted from the prohibition. CO 2 is
exempted under 608 meaning that
it can be legally vented. Although
CO 2 may legally be vented, section
609 still requires that all MVAC sys-
tems be serviced through the proper
use of EPA-certified refrigerant han-
dling equipment. This requirement
applies regardless of the refriger-
ant used in the MVAC system. This
means that anyone servicing an
MVAC system that uses CO 2 as the
refrigerant would need to properly
use EPA-certified refrigerant han-
dling equipment.
```
```
shops, chain or franchised repair shops, new and used
car and truck dealers, rental establishments, radiator
repair shops, mobile repair operations, vocational tech-
nical schools (because instructors are paid), farm equip-
ment dealerships and fleets of vehicles at airports.
```
```
Technician Training and Certification
Requirements
To become certified, technicians must pass a test dem-
onstrating their knowledge in the use of refrigerant
recovery/recycling equipment, the EPA’s regulatory re-
quirements, the importance of refrigerant containment
and the effects of ozone depletion and environmental
change.
```
```
Overlap Between Sections 608 and 609
of the Clean Air Act
Section 608 of the Clean Air Act prohibits the venting of
refrigerants, unless specifically exempted. C0 2 is the only
MVAC refrigerant that is exempt. This includes the scrap-
ping/salvage of vehicles that have mobile A/C systems.
Section 608 covers procedures involving motor vehicle
(and certain other means of transportation) air condition-
ers (MVACs) that are not covered by Section 609, such as
the disposal of MVACs. Following is information concern-
ing specific areas where the overlap between these two
sets of regulations may require clarification.
```

#### © 2018 MOBILE AIR CONDITIONING SOCIETY WORLDWIDE

Section 609 of the Clean Air Act establishes standards
specifically for the service of MVACs. MVACs are included
in the definition of appliances under the stipulations
put forth in Section 608; however, since their service
and repair are regulated under Section 609, they are not
subject to the servicing requirements put forth in Sec-
tion 608.

Both regulations require that technicians become certi-
fied. Technicians who repair or service MVACs must be
trained and certified by an EPA-approved Section 609
program. These programs are specifically designed to
cover MVAC refrigerant recovery, recycling and charging
equipment and procedures in accordance with SAE Stan-
dards, and Section 609 regulatory requirements. After
completing a required training program, MVAC techni-
cians must pass a test to become certified. These tests
are different from the Section 608 certification tests.

Under Section 608, the EPA has established four types of
certification for technicians that service and repair ap-
pliances other than MVACs. To be certified, technicians
must pass a test applicable to the appropriate appliance
type. Training and review classes for Section 608 are

_Do you need Section 609 Certification, Section 608 Certification, or maybe both? This chart will tell you which type(s) you need._

**608 vs. 609**

```
voluntary; only passing the test is mandatory. The four
categories of Section 608 certification are:
Type I: Small appliances
Type II: High-pressure appliances (except small ap-
pliances) and MVACs
Type III: Low-pressure appliances
Type IV (Universal): All appliances except MVACs
People who service or repair MVAC-like appliances (e.g.
farm equipment and other off-road vehicles) can choose
to be certified by either the Section 609 program or un-
der Section 608 Type II. However, due to the similarities
between MVAC and MVAC-like appliances, the EPA recom-
mends that technicians servicing MVAC-like appliances
consider certification under Section 609.
Note: While buses using CFC-12 or HFC-134a are MVACs,
buses and other vehicles using HCFC-22 as refrigerant
are not classified as MVACs or MVAC-like appliances,
but rather as high-pressure equipment covered under
Section 608 Type II. Certification under Section 608 is
also required to service cargo refrigeration equipment.

_The refrigerant R/R/R machine label above states “certified...
to meet SAE J2788 superseding J2210.”_

Purity of Recycled CFC-

The SAE J1991 standard of purity for on-site recycled
CFC-12 states that the refrigerant shall not exceed the
following levels of contaminants:

```
Moisture: 15 Parts Per Million (PPM) by weight
Oil: 4000 PPM by weight
Air (non-condensable gases): 330 PPM by weight
```
EPA regulations require that certified CFC-12 recovery/
recycling equipment must conform to the specifications
listed in SAE standard J1990. The equipment must also
have a label, which states: “Design certified for compli-
ance with SAE J1991.”

Purity of Recycled HFC-134a

The SAE J2099 standard of purity for on-site recycled
HFC-134a states that the refrigerant shall not exceed the
following levels of contaminants:

```
Moisture: 50 PPM by weight
Oil: 500 PPM by weight
Air (non-condensable gases): 150 PPM by weight
```
EPA regulations require that certified HFC-134a recov-
ery/recycling equipment must conform to the specifica-
tions listed in the appropriate standard. The equipment
must have a label, which states: “Design certified for
compliance with SAE J2210 or J2788.”

More Complete Refrigerant Recovery

In 2007 recovery/recycling equipment standard J
was superseded by SAE J2788. The new J2788 equipment
provides more complete refrigerant recovery, and also
establishes refrigerant charging requirements providing
greater accuracy.

Also in 2007, recovery-only equipment standard SAE
J1732 was superseded by SAE J2810. The new J
equipment provides more complete refrigerant recovery.

## Recycling vs. Reclaiming

```
Recycling versus reclaiming refrigerant... there
is a difference!
Recycled refrigerant is that which has been pro-
cessed on-site at a service facility, using recycling
equipment certified to the appropriate SAE J stan-
dard.
Reclaimed refrigerant is that which has been sent
to an EPA-listed reclamation facility where it is
processed and returned to a state which meets
the appropriate ARI 700 specification.
The standards of purity for reclaimed refrigerant
are much higher than those for recycled refriger-
ant.
```
```
Please Note!
Recovery/recycling equipment is not designed to
recycle or separate contaminated refrigerants.
Contaminated or unknown refrigerant must be re-
moved from a system using dedicated recovery-
only equipment, and properly disposed of. Under
federal law, contaminated refrigerant cannot be
vented.
```

Service Equipment Hoses

Hoses used with mobile A/C system service equipment
must be equipped with shut-off valves. The valves may
be either manual or automatic. The shut-off valves must
be located within 12 inches (30 cm) of the “vehicle end”
of the service hose, and most equipment manufacturers
incorporate the shut-off valve in their quick-couplers.
These automatically shut off the flow of refrigerant
when the hoses are disconnected.

Fittings that are unique to individual refrigerants must
be attached to the “vehicle end” of service hoses.
Adapters for different refrigerants, different systems, or
different service port designs may not be attached to
service hoses, then removed and replaced with adapters
for a different refrigerant.

meet the federal compliance requirements and cannot be
used to service mobile A/C systems. To prevent refriger-
ant contamination, recovery/recycling equipment must
only be used with one designated refrigerant.

```
Equipment Registration
It is the responsibility of the recovery/recycling equip-
ment owner, or another responsible person, to notify the
EPA that they own approved equipment. The information
in the following bullet points must be mailed to the EPA
regional office for the state or territory in which the
establishment is located.
Name, address and telephone number of the estab-
lishment where the recovery/recycling equipment
is located;
Name brand, model number, year and serial
number(s) of the equipment acquired for use at the
above establishment.
The above information can be submitted on a plain sheet
of paper, or can be submitted on the form the equipment
manufacturers provide for this purpose. A copy of this
form is provided on pages 57 and 58 of this manual. You
may photocopy it for your use.
The person responsible for the equipment must sign
the form. The person who signs is certifying that they
are responsible for the equipment, that each individual
assigned to use the equipment is properly trained and
certified, and that the information provided is true and
correct. The repair facility is required to file this certi-
fication only one time. The shop owner should keep a
copy of the equipment certification on file.
```
```
Other Record Keeping Requirements
Note: All records listed below must be retained for a
period of three years.
As mentioned above, any person who owns refrig-
erant recovery/recycling equipment and provides
service for monetary value, must have records veri-
fying that all persons operating the equipment are
certified.
Any person who owns refrigerant recovery or recov-
ery/recycling equipment must maintain records of
the name and address of any facility to which refrig-
erant is sent.
Any person who sells Class I substances (chlo-
rofluorocarbons/CFCs) or Class II substances
(hydrochlorofluorocarbons/HCFCs) for use as mobile
A/C system refrigerants must prominently display a
sign which states: “It is a violation of federal law to

Standard J2197: HFC-134a Service Hose Fittings for
Automotive Air Conditioning Service Equipment
Issuing Committee: SAE International Interior Climate
Control Steering Committee
This SAE Standard covers fittings intended for con-
necting service hoses, per SAE J2196, from mobile air
conditioning systems to service equipment such as
manifold gauges, vacuum pumps and air conditioning
charging, recovery and recycling equipment. Due to
similarities between English and metric thread sizes,
a single, unique ACME thread fitting is specified. This
fitting was recommended by the Compressed Gas As-
sociation (CGA), Connection Standards Committee
Task Force as one which could be qualified to meet
their requirements for use and safety in a time frame
consistent with the introduction of R-134a. It was
selected because its unique design would reduce
the likelihood of cross-threading service hoses on R-
12/R-134a refrigerant storage containers and service
equipment. The high and low pressure hose in SAE
J2196 requires the charge coupling (used to connect
service hoses to vehicle access ports) to be an inte-
gral part of the hose assembly. To allow removal of
the hose from the coupling for hose replacement only,
a two-piece construction with a wrench tight connec-
tion is permitted.

Equipment Certification

To comply with Section 609 of the Clean Air Act, recovery/
recycling equipment must be certified to SAE specifica-
tions. Recovery/recycling equipment used for commercial
refrigeration, and not certified to SAE standards, does not

It is not required under federal regulations to re-
move refrigerant from a leaking system. However,
this action may be required under state and local
laws. It is the technician’s responsibility to deter-
mine if a more stringent policy is applicable in their
location.
Service facilities may adopt a policy to not add refrig-
erant to leaking systems, but the policy should be ex-
plained to the customer, including in the explanation
the fact that the policy is not a federal or local govern-
mental requirement.
Technicians should offer to fix leaks in air conditioning
systems. It helps protect the environment and conserves
refrigerant. In addition, eliminating leakage can prolong
the life of the A/C system. It is not correct, however, to
state or imply that leak repair is required under federal
law. Doing so would constitute consumer fraud.
If a customer arrives with refrigerant in their A/C system,
a technician removes it, then the customer declines any
further services, the technician must return to the system
the refrigerant it contained when it arrived, unless the
customer agrees to its removal.
```
```
Regulations Applicable to Vehicle
Salvage and/or Disposal Facilities
Vehicle salvage and disposal facilities must remove re-
frigerants from salvaged or scrapped mobile A/C sys-
tems. Facilities that have certified recovery equipment
can recover refrigerant at their facility and also move
the equipment to other facilities to recover refrigerant.
The salvage employee does not have to be certified to
perform these operations.
If CFC-12, this refrigerant can be sold to technicians
certified under Section 609. Until January 1, 2018, if
HFC-134a, it can be sold to anyone wishing to purchase
it. After January 1, 2018, if CFC-12, HFC-134a or HFO-
1234yf, these refrigerants can only be sold to certified
technicians (see page 52).
Section 609 certified technicians that are not employed by
the salvage or disposal facility can remove CFC-12 and HFC-
134a from mobile A/C systems at the salvage and/or dis-
posal facility. There is no requirement to identify the purity
of this refrigerant, or label tanks as containing refrigerant
removed from vehicles at these facilities. It is important
to keep in mind that refrigerant removed from vehicles at
salvage and disposal facilities may be contaminated.
Salvage and disposal facilities must keep records docu-
menting when and if someone not directly employed by
them removed refrigerant from vehicles at their facility.
```
```
sell containers of Class I and Class II refrigerant to
any person who is not properly trained and certified
to operate approved refrigerant recovery/recycling
equipment.”
Section 608 of the Clean Air Act requires that all
persons who sell CFC and HCFC refrigerants must re-
tain invoices that list the name of the purchaser, the
date of the sale, and the quantity of refrigerant pur-
chased. However, since the sale of small containers
of CFC-12 is restricted to technicians certified under
Section 609, these record-keeping requirements do
not apply to the sale of small containers of CFC-12.
Mobile A/C service facilities must allow an autho-
rized representative of the EPA entry onto their
premises, (upon presentation of appropriate creden-
tials) and give the authorized representative access
to all required records.
```
Further Mobile A/C Service Rules and

Regulations

```
Every compensated technician that opens the re-
frigerant circuit must be certified. This includes
technicians that only add refrigerant to “top off” a
system. Facilities that typically only change or add
fluids, such as lube-oil-filter operations, must have
certified technicians and equipment.
Section 608 of the Clean Air Act prohibits intention-
ally releasing (also called venting) ozone depleting
refrigerants and most alternatives (including all
HFCs, HFOs, and their blends) while maintaining, ser-
vicing, repairing, or disposing of MVACs and MVAC-like
equipment. CO 2 refrigerants are exempted from the
venting prohibition.
It is permissible to only recover CFC-12, HFC-134a,
HFO-1234yf and other refrigerants. In this circum-
stance, the refrigerant must be sent off-site for
recycling – reprocessing (reclaiming) before reuse –
or disposal.
CFC-12, HFC-134a and HFO-1234yf removed from sys-
tems must be recycled before they can be reused,
even if they are to be reinstalled into the same sys-
tem from which they were removed. Blends must be
recovered and sent off-site for proper disposal.
Under federal law, it is legal to add refrigerant to a
pre-existing leaking system. However, some states
and local municipalities may have laws prohibiting
this practice. It is the technician’s responsibility to
determine if a more stringent policy is applicable in
their location.
```

#### © 2018 MOBILE AIR CONDITIONING SOCIETY WORLDWIDE

If applicable, they must also keep records documenting
the sale of ozone-depleting refrigerants.

A Further Word on Recovery-only

Equipment

The operation of recovery-only equipment is similar to
the recovery feature of recovery/recycling equipment.
However, recovery-only equipment is designed for the
sole purpose of removing refrigerant from a system; it
does not recycle refrigerant for reuse. Before it can be
reused, the refrigerant must be recycled through use of
a recovery/recycling machine which meets the appropri-
ate SAE standard, or sent off-site to be reprocessed to
the appropriate Air-Conditioning and Refrigeration In-
stitute (ARI) ARI 700 specification.

CFC-12 recovery-only (and recovery/recycling) equip-
ment hoses have SAE 3/8-inch fittings; HFC-134a and
HFO-1234yf recovery-only (and recovery/recycling
equipment hoses have quick couple fittings. Do not use
adapter fittings with recovery-only machines or their
tanks. Use of adapter fittings could result in contamina-
tion of refrigerant as well as A/C systems.

Standard J2209: Refrigerant Recovery Equipment
for Mobile Automotive Air Conditioning Systems
Issuing Committee: SAE International Interior Climate
Control Service Committee
The purpose of this SAE Standard is to provide
equipment specifications for CFC-12 (R-12) recovery
for return to a refrigerant reclamation facility that
will process it to the appropriate ARI Standard (Air-
Conditioning and Refrigerant Institute) or allow for
recycling of the recovered refrigerant in equipment
that is certified to meet the requirements of SAE
J1991. Under the existing rule, the U.S. EPA requires
refrigerant removed from a mobile air conditioning
(A/C) system using recovery equipment certified to
meet SAE J2209 can only be recycled using equip-
ment meeting SAE J1991 that is owned by the same
company or individual. It is not acceptable that the
refrigerant removed from a mobile A/C system, with
this equipment, be directly returned to a mobile A/C
system. This information applies to equipment used
to service automobiles, light trucks, and other ve-
hicles with similar CFC-12 (R-12) systems.

Refrigerant containment is an important part of ser-
vicing mobile air conditioning systems. This procedure
provides guidelines for technicians for servicing mo-
bile A/C systems and operating refrigerant recycling
equipment. (This standard stresses the importance
of refrigerant containment and offers guidelines on
proper equipment use. Since this standard was is-

### Service Procedures for Mobile Air Conditioning Systems

#### SAFETY PRECAUTIONS & WARNINGS

1. ALWAYS wear eye protection when servicing air conditioning systems or handling refrigerant.
2. Avoid breathing refrigerant and lubricant vapor or mist. Exposure may irritate eyes, nose and throat. Acute ex-
    posure can result in asphyxiation. If accidental discharge occurs, ventilate the work area.
3. Do not allow refrigerants to come in contact with open flames and high-temperature surfaces. Decomposition is
hazardous, and can occur if refrigerant is exposed to high temperatures (open flames, hot metal surfaces, etc.)
4. HFC-134a is not flammable at normal ambient temperatures and atmospheric pressure. However, tests have
    shown it to be combustible at certain pressures and ambient temperatures when mixed with air under pressure
    in a sealed environment. Service equipment or vehicle A/C systems should not be pressure tested or leak tested
    with compressed air.
5. PAG lubricant is hygroscopic (absorbs moisture). Containers must be kept tightly closed.
6. PAG lubricant can be a skin irritant. Protective impervious gloves are required to prevent lubricant contact with
    the skin. To help avoid skin contact, mineral oil should be used to coat o-rings and seals prior to installation.
    Also, since PAG lubricants absorb moisture, using mineral oil reduces the potential for fitting corrosion.
7. PAG lubricants can cause damage to paint, underhood plastic parts, engine drive belts and coolant hoses. Care
    should be taken to prevent PAG lubricants from coming into contact with these items.
8. Failure to follow instructions provided by A/C system service equipment manufacturers could result in personal
injury or equipment damage.
9. To prevent refrigerant cross-contamination, use separate service equipment for each refrigerant. Lubricant and
refrigerant left in hoses and equipment can be a source of cross-contamination.
10. NEVER transfer refrigerants to a cylinder or tank unless it is Department of Transportation approved for refill-
ing. DOT approval is indicated by the designation “DOT 4BA” or “DOT 4BW” stamped on a tank’s collar (handle).
11. If a refrigerant tank is overfilled, it may explode. To prevent this from occurring, when transferring refrigerant into
a tank, the safe filling level must be controlled by weight, and must not exceed 60% of the tank’s gross weight
rating.
12. NEVER perform service on recovery/recycling/recharge equipment (other than routine maintenance) without
first consulting authorized service personnel. The removal of internal fittings and filters can cause the escape
of refrigerant under pressure.
13. NEVER perform maintenance or service on recovery/recycling/recharge equipment with the unit plugged into
electric power unless directed otherwise.
14. Avoid using extension cords with recovery/recycling/recharge equipment. If this is unavoidable, use a minimum
    length, 3-wire (No. 14 AWG minimum) cord with a ground circuit. To prevent shock hazards and reduce the risk
    of fire, make sure the extension cord is in good condition (not worn or frayed) with the ground circuit intact.
15. Recovery/recycling/recharge equipment often contains parts that may produce arcs or sparks. Do not use this
    equipment near flammable liquids or vapors.
16. Fuel injection systems on some vehicles contain a service port the same size as one of the CFC-12 A/C system
service ports. Be careful not to attach A/C service equipment to a vehicle’s fuel injection system.
Additional health and safety information may be obtained from equipment, refrigerant and lubricant manufactur-
ers. Refer to their instruction manuals and Material Safety Data Sheets.

**_Caution: When using recovery/recycling/recharge
equipment, while it is very important to follow the
general service procedures outlined in this manual, it is
also very important to follow your equipment manufac-_**

turer’s instructions. Failure to follow these instructions
could result in personal injury, damage to the equip-
ment or A/C systems, or improper or inadequate refrig-
erant recovery, recycling and containment.
```

Maintaining Your Refrigerant Recovery/

Recycling/Recharge Equipment

Recovery/recycling/recharge equipment should be
checked frequently to ensure that no leaks exist within
the internal refrigerant flow circuits, as well as the ex-
ternal hoses and seals. Filters/driers must also be re-
placed in accordance with the machine manufacturer’s
specifications (check the equipment manual for filter
location). Regular maintenance of your recovery/recy-
cling/recharge machines helps to ensure that the SAE
standards of purity for recycled refrigerant are met.

```
The seals on service equipment hoses must be frequently inspect-
ed for damage and replaced when necessary. This shows a com-
parison between a new seal (left) and a used one that is swollen
and distorted (right).
```
_R/R/R machine internal plumbing must be periodically checked to
make sure no leaks are present._

```
R/R/R machine filters/driers must be replaced in accordance with
the machine manufacturer’s recommendations.
```

Before You Begin...

Refrigerant Identifiers

A refrigerant identifier can help alert you to air condi-
tioning system refrigerant contamination problems. The
service industry and EPA strongly recommend, but do
not require the use of this equipment. You can also use
an identifier to help confirm what type of refrigerant
is in a container. The identifier should conform to the
specifications outlined in SAE J1771, J2912 or J2927;
this assures that the unit correctly identifies refriger-
ants. (Note: only J1771 units are required to identify
CFC-12.) Keep in mind however, that even the best iden-
tifier may not be capable of indicating all of the possible
combinations of chemicals that may be in an A/C system
or storage tank.

```
Before connecting service equipment, always perform a visual in-
spection of the A/C system to spot any obvious problems.
```
```
The caps are the service ports’ primary seal against refrigerant
leakage. Always make sure that every service port has one in place.
```
Ensure System Integrity

As a first step in service, always perform a visual in-
spection to spot obvious problems. Since the service
port caps serve as the primary seal for the service ports,
make sure that each service port in the system has a
cap installed, and that the caps’ seals are not damaged.
Missing or damaged service port caps are major leak
sources. After service on the system is completed, make
sure that each service port has a cap reinstalled, and
that all of the caps seal properly.

_While not required by federal law, the use of a refrigerant iden-
tifier is strongly recommended. It can help you determine if a
vehicle contains contaminated refrigerant that you would not
want inside your recovery machine. Identifiers can also provide
an accurate indication concerning the amount of air that may be
in an A/C system or storage tank. Some state or local laws may
require their use._

```
Prior to system disassembly, look for the presence of re-
frigerant oil on adjacent surfaces that could be a sign of
a leak. Clean all dirt, grease and debris from and around
connection points before servicing. Carefully inspect re-
frigerant connections, joint seals and seal surfaces for
signs of wear, deformation, contamination or damage.
When reassembling components, ensure proper align-
ment of male/female connections and seal, then tighten
the connection to the correct torque value specified by
the manufacturer.
```
```
Check for Pressure in the System
It would make no sense to attempt refrigerant recovery
from a system that contains no refrigerant. Because of
this, always check to see if the system has pressure by
```
### Refrigerant Recovery and Recycling Procedures


#### © 2018 MOBILE AIR CONDITIONING SOCIETY WORLDWIDE

connecting a pressure gauge to a system service port
before starting a recovery process.

If a system contains no pressure, it is a safe assumption
that the refrigerant has leaked out, and one of your first
steps in service should be trying to track down a leak or
leaks in the system.

If a system has some pressure but contains an unknown
amount of refrigerant, additional refrigerant can be added
to check the system’s operation. To provide the best sys-
tem diagnosis, it is advisable that the current refrigerant
be recovered and the factory charge amount be added.

The Effect of System Design on the

Refrigerant Recovery Process

When refrigerant is removed from the system, the low-
ering of pressure results in some of the system compo-
nents becoming cooler. This component cooling effect
makes complete refrigerant removal in a short period of
time more difficult.

To remove as much of the refrigerant as possible dur-
ing the recovery process, systems equipped with orifice
tubes and accumulators may require more time than sys-
tems equipped with expansion valves/receiver-driers.

During the recovery process, as the system is drawn into
a vacuum, and pressure in the accumulator is lowered,
the accumulator becomes very cold, with external frost
sometimes visible on the accumulator. This makes it even
more difficult to extract remaining refrigerant from it. If
all or most of the refrigerant has not been removed and
the refrigerant lines are disconnected, a sudden release
of refrigerant and oil can occur.

Heating the accumulator with devices such as a hair dry-
er or electric heating pad will raise the pressure in the
accumulator and reduce the amount of time necessary
for refrigerant removal.

When recovering refrigerant from any mobile A/C system,
continue the recovery process until the system has been
reduced from a pressure to a vacuum. At this point, pause
operation of the recovery machine for five minutes, and
check A/C system pressure. If pressure has risen above
vacuum, additional recovery is required to remove remain-
ing refrigerant. Repeat the recovery process until the vac-
uum remains stable, without rising, for two minutes.

Many recovery/recycling machines have a built-in five-
minute wait period after the system is first drawn into a
vacuum, and if a rise in system pressure is sensed, will
automatically repeat the recovery process until the sys-
tem will remain at a stable vacuum.

```
Heating an accumulator during refrigerant recovery is a good
idea. The heat will raise pressure inside the accumulator, allow-
ing it to more easily outgas refrigerant it contains. This will re-
duce the amount of time necessary for more complete refrigerant
removal.
```
```
Cautions:
```
**_1. At no time should an open flame torch be used to_**
    **_heat the accumulator.
2. All refrigerant must be removed before opening any_**
    **_of the system’s connections._**

```
More Complete Refrigerant Recovery
The amount of refrigerant you can recover from a system
depends on how much is in the system, of course, but also
ambient temperature, the technique you use, and the per-
formance of the recovery machine itself. When you draw
out the refrigerant, the vacuum lowers the temperatures
in the system; the oil chills and forms a virtually impen-
etrable blanket over some of the refrigerant.
To recover as much refrigerant as possible, warm up the
system’s underhood components with engine heat and,
as already mentioned, apply external heat to the accu-
mulator (if the system has one).

J2851, J3030 do not require this pre-warming proce-
dure.

listed in steps 1 and 2 above
Start refrigerant recovery process
When refrigerant recovery is completed, in-
cluding the required 5 minute recheck for
system pressure (system refrigerant out gas-
sing), shut vehicle and equipment off.
Tests performed for an SAE research program indicated
that you can remove a higher percentage of the refriger-
ant by applying heat and performing recovery after the
early morning ambient chill has gone.
There are also differences in the percentage of refriger-
ant that’s recovered using best practices versus shortcuts.
A single “pull” on a cool morning might remove 60% of
the charge, whereas a careful procedure, using heat to
promote outgassing, might remove the over 90% that is
necessary for accurate service.
Improperly Recycled Refrigerant
It is important to make sure that recycled refrigerant
does not contain air (non-condensable gas) in excess of
allowable amounts. If recycled refrigerant contains too
much air, high system operating pressure will occur. This
will result in loss of air conditioning performance and
possible system damage.
Properly operating recovery/recycling equipment will
remove excess air. Many newer R/R machines have an
automatic air purge feature which, if working properly,
should assure that its recycled refrigerant will not con-
tain excessive levels of air. However, many older R/R
machines require manual air purge.
Make sure you understand which type of air purge feature
your machine has and follow its manufacturer’s instruc-
tions to assure that proper air purging is taking place.
**_Note: Refrigerant contamination, by air, chemical ad-
ditives or other refrigerants, can cause system operat-
ing problems._**

System Lubricants

CFC-12 systems use mineral-based lubricants. HFC-134a
systems use polyalkylene glycol (PAG) lubricants. Hy-
brid vehicles with electrically driven compressors use
special A/C system lubricants.

```
Here is a typical recovery machine’s oil recovery reservoir. It should
be emptied before each recovery operation, then checked when re-
covery is completed to see how much (if any) oil was removed from
the system during recovery. If oil was removed, that same quantity
of fresh new oil of the type the system requires must be reinstalled
in the system before it is put back into operation.
```
_Different HFC-134a systems require the use of different oils. You
must install the type and viscosity recommended by the system
or compressor manufacturer. To find out the type you need to
use, refer to the underhood A/C system information label, or
look it up in a service manual or electronic information system._

```
list the lubricant’s viscosity. You may need to consult
another source (such as a parts catalog or service infor-
mation) to obtain the lubricant’s viscosity rating.
Recovery-only and recovery/recycling equipment will
separate the lubricant during the refrigerant recovery
process, so properly recycled refrigerant will not contain
too much lubricant.
In general, recovery equipment will remove very little, if
any, lubricant from a system. It is a design requirement
of the equipment that the amount of lubricant removed
during recovery must be measurable. This is usually (but
not always) indicated by removed oil being collected in
a transparent graduated container.
If a large quantity of lubricant was removed during recov-
ery, the A/C system probably had a lubricant overcharge.
To replace any lubricant removed during a recovery pro-
cess, use only new lubricant of the type and viscosity
specified by the vehicle or compressor manufacturer.
Lubricant removed during recovery must not be reused
in the system. Used lubricant should be disposed of in
accordance with federal, state and local requirements
(visit http://www.ecarcenter.org/ecartour.html for more informa-
tion on specific disposal requirements).
```
To prevent damage to the compressor or system, it is im-
perative that the correct type and viscosity of lubricant
(and correct amount of lubricant) is used in an A/C system.

Too little, or the wrong viscosity oil can cause inter-
nal compressor failure. But too much oil can also cause
problems. Too much oil can cause the compressor to
“liquid slug,” possibly even hydraulically lock up. Too
much oil can also result in reduced overall system per-
formance. The excess oil can heavily coat the interior
surfaces of the heat exchangers, insulating the refriger-
ant from those surfaces.

Do not mix lubricants. Use only the type of lubricant
specified by the system manufacturer. The A/C system
label will identify the vehicle, compressor or A/C system
manufacturer’s recommended lubricant, often by an OE
part number or designation. However, the label may not

ing oil that the system requires._

## Best Service Practices for Mobile A/C Systems.

### Sources of Refrigerant Emissions

```
Your electronic leak detector(s) must be certified to meet the SAE
spec (the detector should be labeled as such), and must be used
in accordance with the procedures outlined in the SAE J1628 spec.
We’ve provided an overview of J1628 under “Using Electronic Leak
Detectors,” (this page) and in the sidebar on page 19.
```
```
Typical leak detector certification label. It shows that this leak
detector meets the minimum performance requirements outlined
in SAE standard J2791.
```
Motor vehicle air conditioning systems can release re-
frigerant into the atmosphere in a number of ways:

```
Leaks from system part failures and seepage, which
occur when a leak is not repaired and the system is
recharged or “topped off.”
Refrigerant released during various service procedures.
Refrigerant released from service equipment, mani-
fold gauges and equipment hoses.
When using small cans to charge a system, refrigerant
remaining in the can is likely to ultimately be vent-
ed. The refrigerant remaining in larger (30 pound)
disposable containers that has not been recovered is
also sometimes vented when they are scrapped.
Collision or other types of physical damage.
```
Checking Mobile A/C Systems for Leaks

The EPA and MACS recommend that leaking systems should
be repaired. To pinpoint leaks in mobile A/C systems,
MACS recommends using the SAE J1628 service procedure.

This requires the use of an electronic leak detector certi-
fied to SAE standard J1627, J2791 or J2913. As minimum
criteria, J1627 electronic leak detectors are capable of
identifying leakage rates of 0.5 ounces per year at a
distance of 1/4 inch from the leak point.

Detectors which have the most sensitive detection lev-
els will help identify smaller leaks. Manufacturers’ ser-
vice and maintenance procedures must be followed to
ensure proper operation of the equipment.

SAE standard J2791 (covering HFC-134a) and J2913 (cov-
ering for HFO-1234yf) electronic leak detectors, requires
improved performance compared to J1627 detectors. De-
tectors certified to this standard, have the capability of
identifying leakage rates as low as 0.15 ounces per year
at a distance of 3/8 inch.

The charts on the next page provide a comparison for
different types of leak detection devices and methods.

Using Electronic Leak Detectors

The following procedures are recommended by A/C system
manufacturers to best identify system leaks, and are also
an overview of the SAE J1628 leak detection procedure.

The system should first be visually inspected by looking
for traces of oil on refrigeration system components. Oil
traces can be indications of possible leak sites.


#### © 2018 MOBILE AIR CONDITIONING SOCIETY WORLDWIDE

The vehicle’s engine should not be running during the
leak check, since air movement can affect the detec-
tor’s ability to locate leaks. All fittings and components
should be checked on all of their surfaces. Leaks can be
present at any point, at the top or bottom of the part
being checked. (Cleaning the surface with a clean cloth
can be helpful. Do NOT use any cleaning solvent!)

To prevent contamination, leak detection must only be
done with the refrigerant that is specified for the sys-
tem. Do not attempt to use shop air for leak detection
purposes. This may introduce air, moisture and other con-
taminants to the system. The use of other gases under
high pressure, such as nitrogen, can result in damage to
the A/C system (for example, it may cause an evaporator
to rupture). Plus, as shown in Chart A (see above) high
pressure gas and soap bubbles will not detect small leaks.

```
The SAE J1628 procedure does not require a fully charged
A/C system. If the system has only a few ounces of re-
frigerant and at least 50 psig of pressure (at approx-
imately 55° F), that is sufficient to check for a leak.
Static pressure will be higher with the same amount of
refrigerant if the working area temperature is warmer.
For example, with HFC-134a, the pressure will be about
125 psig at 100° F.
If the system is completely empty, it will be necessary
to add some refrigerant to the system in order to use an
electronic leak detector. About 15% of the total system
charge is enough to obtain a minimum system pressure of
around 50 psi. Once the system contains sufficient refrig-
erant, adding more will not increase pressure.
With this limited amount of refrigerant, you can deter-
mine if the system has a leak, but you cannot determine
if the system will provide cooling. If you intend to oper-
ate the compressor, the system must contain its speci-
fied amount of refrigerant.
CAUTION: To prevent possible compressor damage, do
not operate the compressor without the full charge of
refrigerant as specified by the vehicle manufacturer.
```
_Chart B: This chart compares the effectiveness of SAE J1627 and
J2791 electronic leak detectors._

NOTES:

_Chart A: This chart demonstrates the effectiveness of various
leak detection methods. Soap bubbles will only identify leaks
that are in excess of 1100 grams (about 40 ounces) per year,
compared to the use of an SAE J1627, J2791 or J2913 electronic
leak detector, which can identify leakage rates as low as 4 grams
(0.15 ounce) per year._

Another (Big) Reason to Find and Fix

Refrigerant Leaks

Loss of refrigerant can reduce oil circulation – even be-
fore the low pressure switch or other sensor cuts power
to the compressor clutch. Clutchless compressors may
operate until a catastrophic failure occurs.

**1. What conditions can affect the ability of**
    **electronic leak detectors to find leaks?**
_Dirt and moisture coming in contact with the detector’s
probe tip can be hindrances when it comes to electronic
leak detection. Distance from the probe to the leak site
and windy environments also dramatically reduce detec-
tors’ abilities to pinpoint leaks._
**2. What should a technician look for when**
    **purchasing an electronic leak detector?**
_Technicians should look at the type of sensor technol-
ogy used, and whether they are comfortable with the
pros and cons of that type. They should also look at de-
tector sensitivity, power requirements and battery life.
Practical considerations like the length and flexibility of
the probe in order to get into hard-to-reach places, what
type of maintenance the unit requires and the unit’s ease
of use should also be considered._
**3. What is the best way to use an electronic**
    **leak detector?**
_High temperatures increase system pressure and there-
fore leak rates and actually help to find leaks. Conversely,
cold temperatures, especially below 60° F, may reduce
pressure/leak rate enough to make it difficult to find
leaks.
According to SAE International, the best procedures for
using electronic leak detection are detailed in SAE docu-
ment J1628._
    _a. The document specifies that the user should perform_
       _leak detection in accordance with the equipment_
       _manufacturer’s operating instructions and with the_
       _engine off._
    _b. In order to get the best performance, the system_
       _should be sufficiently charged with refrigerant to_

```
maintain at least 50 psi. This may not be possible
when the work area temperature falls below 55° F.
c. When working with the detector, care should be
taken to not contaminate the detector probe. If
cleaning of a part is necessary, do not use cleaners
or solvents, which may contain substances that the
detector will sense.
d. A visual inspection should be made for signs of lu-
bricant leakage, damage and corrosion, and each
damaged area should be inspected with the de-
tector. Other areas to concentrate on are fittings,
couplings, valves, service port caps, brazed or weld-
ed areas and component attachment points. Take
care to inspect the entire system so no potential
source of leaks will be missed.
e. To obtain the best chance of detecting the leak,
move the probe no faster than 1-2 inches per second
and hold it no more than 1/4-inch from the surface.
If you find a potential leak, verify it by blowing shop
air around the area and retesting.
f. Leak testing of the evaporator core is a challenging
task. This is best accomplished by running the air
conditioner blower on high for at least 15 seconds,
and then turning the blower off. Wait for refrigerant
to accumulate in the evaporator case (the manufac-
turer of the equipment will specify the amount of
time). By inserting the leak detector probe into the
blower resistor hole (if near evaporator), condensate
drain or other appropriate opening (use a heater or
vent duct as a last resort), you should be able to
perform a refrigerant leak test.
g. When all service has been completed, leak test the
system again to verify a complete repair.
```
## Three Questions about Electronic Leak Detectors

```
If a vehicle comes into your shop with a failed compressor
and the system is low on refrigerant, just replacing the
compressor is not going to fix the apparent leak. It is im-
portant to determine if there were multiple leak sources.
```
NOTES:


#### © 2018 MOBILE AIR CONDITIONING SOCIETY WORLDWIDE

To isolate a suspected leak site in an area where air
currents could dissipate leaking refrigerant, if pos-
sible, tape a piece of aluminum foil or plastic wrap
around the connection or component. Allow some
time for possible leaking refrigerant to collect in the
plastic wrap or foil. Then, make a small hole in the
foil or wrap at the lowest area possible and place the
leak detector probe at the hole to check for the leak.
Lastly, most electronic leak detectors require periodic
maintenance to function properly. Refer to your leak
detector’s instruction manual for more information.

## Another Tip on Using

## Electronic Leak Detectors

_To help confirm a suspected leak, place aluminum foil or
plastic wrap and tape it around the connection or compo-
nent. If there truly is a leak, after a few minutes, refrigerant
should accumulate inside the plastic wrap or foil. Make a
small hole in the foil or wrap at the lowest point possible
and place your leak detector probe at the hole. The detector
will indicate “refrigerant found” if a leak is actually present._

```
Using Dye to Find Leaks
Ultraviolet (fluorescent) trace dye systems are a popular
choice for techs today in their efforts to hunt down elusive
leaks. Not only are they an inexpensive and easy-to-learn
method of locating leaks, they also have the advantage of
giving the shop visual proof of a leak, which can turn into
an interactive experience with the customer.
```
```
A typical UV dye leak detection kit contains dye, a dye injector
(or some other type of tool to introduce dye to a system), a UV
flashlight, and the correct goggles for the dye being used. Always
wear the goggles to protect your eyes from the UV light. This kit
also contains a special cleaner to remove traces of the dye after
the leak is repaired.
```
```
Dye Formula
Ultraviolet dye is a microscopic particulate suspended in
a base fluid. This base fluid varies from manufacturer to
manufacturer. This particulate and base fluid, when intro-
duced into the refrigeration system, mixes with the lubri-
cant and is transported throughout the A/C system. When
a leak occurs, this particulate seeps out and leaves a stain
on the outside of the component. This stain is then vis-
ible when a specific type of UV light is cast upon it.
Dye manufacturers stress that the purity of the dye and
its thermal stability is crucial, as the dye will often see
A/C system high-side temperatures of over 250° F, then
cycle through evaporator at temperatures in the 30° F to
40° F range. The dye should not contain solvents of any
kind that could damage system components or diminish
the lubricant’s properties (including viscosity).
To this effect, the SAE has issued standard J2297 to en-
sure that dyes are tested for system compatibility, and
to make certain that they will not affect lubricant vis-
cosity when used in proper doses. Make sure your dye
meets this standard; there are some dyes that don’t.
```

#### © 2018 MOBILE AIR CONDITIONING SOCIETY WORLDWIDE

```
Like this technician, always be sure to wear the special goggles
that came with your UV dye leak detection kit. Not only do they
protect your eyes from the UV light, they also make dye traces at
leak sites stand out better.
```
```
You can use a mirror to reflect the UV light underneath compo-
nents in hard to see locations. If dye is present at a leak site, you
should see it glowing.
```
How Much Dye Is Too Much?

It is important that dyes be safely and properly used. Ex-
cessive dye can result in compressor damage. Check the
manufacturer’s recommendation; the basic rule of thumb
is 1/4 oz. per conventional system (up to 3 lbs. refriger-
ant or 10 oz. of oil).

Lamps & Goggles

Most manufacturers design their UV lamps to work best
with their own dyes (so the dye particles fluoresce with
their lamp for the best wavelength), and use a reflector
and lens to direct and filter the light properly. The UV
lamp should also be UL-listed.

The coloration of the special yellow glasses that come
with most UV dye leak detection systems enhance the
dye’s fluorescence and also protect your eyes from UV
rays. UV rays are harmful to your eyes, and you should
not stare at a UV lamp, just as you would not stare di-
rectly at the sun.

Before You Begin Using UV Dye to

Find Leaks

Always start with the dye manufacturer’s instructions.
They vary slightly, but the process is pretty straightfor-
ward. Also, first check to see if there is factory-installed
dye in the A/C system. To prevent damage, dye should
not be added to a system unless the vehicle manufac-
turer has approved the specific product.

Choosing Your Delivery System

A MACS survey found that technicians did not have a con-
sensus on the best way to install dye into A/C systems. It
seems that techs are using just about every method, from
in-hose dye canisters to caulking gun-type/syringe-type
injectors, to simply pouring dye into an open system.

No matter which delivery method you choose, make sure
you have a full refrigerant charge to allow the dye to
thoroughly circulate in the system.

Add the dye, then let it circulate. Refrigerant escapes at
the leak point as gas, but the dye is brought to the leak
site with the lubricant, remaining behind so you can see
it glow under a UV lamp.

Looking for Leaks

When scanning the system with your lamp, put on the
supplied glasses and examine all fittings, lines and com-
ponents. A helpful trick is to use a mirror to reflect the
UV light underneath the components. If you don’t have

```
space for a mirror, then use a clean rag to wipe under-
neath the component and hold the rag under your lamp.
How much time should it take for the leak to appear?
Dye makers say that the dye could take anywhere from a
few minutes to a few days to show up at the leak site(s),
so don’t expect the dye to show up immediately every
single time. The length of time depends on the size and
location of the leak.
```

#### © 2018 MOBILE AIR CONDITIONING SOCIETY WORLDWIDE

In cases where a leak does not become readily apparent,
you might want to consider instructing the customer to
drive the car and use the A/C for a week or so, then bring
it back so you can look for visual evidence of leakage.
Do not let the customer run the car for months before
coming back for their inspection and expect to see dye
traces. Some of these dyes will wash off or lose their
fluorescence over time.

After all system leaks have been identified, and the nec-
essary repairs completed, the system should again be
thoroughly leak tested.

You should find that using an electronic detector, along
with ultraviolet dye, will often lead to great leak detec-
tion results.

Flushing A/C Systems

Most A/C system manufacturers recommend that flush-
ing not be performed. Open vent flushing often will not
remove debris from a system. Connecting flush equip-
ment to the system service ports, even with the valve
cores removed, will not provide adequate system flush-
ing, and may not result in the removal of debris and
other substances. Many A/C system manufacturers con-
sider the use of in-line filters to be an effective method
of trapping debris.

Many A/C system and component manufacturers also
have reservations concerning the use of solvents to flush
systems. Other than possible ineffectiveness, the manu-
facturers’ main area of concern is the fact that some
solvent may remain in the system, because depending
upon a solvent’s boiling point, a vacuum pump may not
remove all of it, even after a prolonged deep vacuum.
This residual solvent can dilute the lubricant, which can
lead to inadequate compressor lubrication and possible
subsequent compressor failure. It could also possibly af-
fect the chemical stability of the refrigerant, seals and
hose materials.

Flushing compounds that are certified to SAE standard
J2670, “Stability and Compatibility Criteria for Additives

_In-liquid-line filters can be installed to trap debris that may be in an A/C system after it has suffered a catastrophic compressor failure.
Filters of this type are available from a number of different A/C parts suppliers._

```
Today’s condensers have very tiny refrigerant multi-flow pas-
sages. Not only can’t you even fully insert a toothpick into some
of them, others are so small, a push pin will barely go in. This is
why attempts to flush debris-clogged condensers are often not
successful.
```
```
and Flushing Materials Intended for Aftermarket Use in
R-134a and R-1234yf Vehicle Air Conditioning Systems,”
have been tested for compatibility with A/C system com-
ponents, and found to be compatible. However, this does
not assure they will clean the component being flushed.
If a flush solvent is used, determine if the solvent is
classified as a hazardous material. Dispose of it in ac-
cordance with local, state and federal regulations (visit
http://www.ecarcenter.org for more information on specific dis-
posal requirements).
```

```
To assure proper performance, vacuum pumps must be serviced at
the intervals specified by their manufacturers. Vacuum pump ser-
vice usually consists of not much more than changing the vacuum
pump’s oil. Typical vacuum pump oil change intervals run from the
oil needing to be changed after every 10 hours of pump operation.
Consult your vacuum pump’s operational manual to find out how
often you need to change its oil.
```
_Note how a “total vacuum” changes as elevation increases. This
is not a concern. If your vacuum pump is working properly, it
will do the job right wherever you are. Just don’t expect to reach
total vacuum with a lower CFM vacuum pump._

A/C System Evacuation

Before a system is recharged, it must be evacuated to
remove air and any remaining refrigerant. It is neces-
sary to use a quality, well-maintained vacuum pump to
perform a worthwhile evacuation. But there’s a lot more
to evacuation than that.

To thoroughly outgas refrigerant, a good vacuum pump,
whether stand-alone or built into a recovery/recycling
machine, should be capable of drawing the system down
to at least 29 inches of vacuum (however, at facilities
located at higher elevations, the gauge reading will
naturally be less; see chart below). A weak or improperly

```
functioning vacuum pump may not be strong enough to
achieve complete refrigerant outgassing and removal of
air. Incomplete refrigerant removal introduces the poten-
tial of overcharging a system, which can result in system
performance problems.
Testing has shown that even when the low-side gauge
reads 29 inches of vacuum (where achievable), the in-
side of the system has not actually reached that level of
vacuum. The gauge reading more indicates the vacuum
level in the service hose, not in the system.
Consider that the small openings in the service valve
cores are major restrictions. It is very difficult to reduce
the actual system to the reading on your gauge, and
even with a very good vacuum pump, it can take a long
time to pull the entire system into a true deep vacuum.
Therefore, manufacturers suggest evacuation times of
30 to 45 minutes to assure that an adequate evacuation
has been performed. However, if a J2788-spec R/R/R
machine was used to recover the refrigerant, this time
can possibly be reduced. Consult the machine’s opera-
tor’s manual for more information.
When it comes to removing moisture, the entire system,
not just the service gauge reading, must be at a true,
deep vacuum.
```

```
So the bottom line is, even the best vacuum pump or
recovery/recycling machine may not remove moisture
through evacuation. The best assurance for control of
excess moisture in the A/C system is to replace the
desiccant.
```
```
Desiccant Failure
When the refrigerant fittings (lines and components)
are left un-capped and open to the atmosphere for an
extended period of time, moisture can enter the sys-
tem and result in the desiccant becoming saturated. It
is advisable to keep the refrigerant circuit connections
closed. If left open for a period longer than normal
servicing activity, the desiccant should be replaced to
provide moisture control. Systems left unsealed during
extended vehicle collision repairs can result in moisture
entry.
```
```
Properly Charging (and Recharging)
Mobile A/C Systems
To reduce refrigerant emissions, newer mobile A/C sys-
tems use less refrigerant. Because of this, today’s systems
are “critical charge.” A critical charge system is one that
is substantially less tolerant to variations in charge.
Undercharges can result in poor cooling, and even worse,
poor lubricant circulation, which can lead to compressor
failures. Overcharges can result in high operating pres-
sures, which can also cause poor cooling performance,
and even component damage. During hot weather, over-
charged systems can shut down from the high side pres-
sure control switch, due to high system pressure. Because
of this, mobile A/C systems should only be charged with
known amounts (by weight) of refrigerant. “Top-off” is no
longer acceptable.
```
NOTES:

_The only way to remove significant moisture from a system is to
replace the desiccant. Not only that, most compressor supplier’s
warranties require that the R/D, A/D, or desiccant be replaced
when one of their compressors is being installed._

```
This machine is displaying the refrigerant charge amount in
pounds and ounces. However, the label on every vehicle you ser-
vice won’t list the spec this way, so calculations will be needed;
an easy place to make a mistake. (Some machines allow you to
change the display units, but how many techs do so every time
they can or should?).
```
### Incorrect System Charges – Some Reasons Why

Following are several more reasons that A/C systems
end up getting charged with the incorrect amount of
refrigerant.

Making an Unintentional Mistake While

Determining the Charge Amount

One reason for incorrect charge is making an uninten-
tional mistake while determining the recharge amount.
We sometimes see this because a vehicle manufacturer
may find out long after a vehicle hits the street that
they can get better A/C performance by increasing or
reducing the system’s charge. Or, there may have been
a late change in a component that changes the charge
spec, and that change was not made on the production
line or on the vehicle’s A/C system information label. So
unless you have access to the latest service bulletins,
you may not know about it.

Sometimes, new refrigerant labels are released. Howev-
er, the odds that a new refrigerant label was actually at-
tached to the vehicle are pretty remote, so checking for
bulletins is important, including those for the not-so-
new models that you’re likely to be working on. Please
keep in mind that the original charge was approved after
testing, so if there’s a new charge specification, it may
not improve cooling under all conditions.

Also, some replacement condensers require a change in
system charge spec, usually a reduction. These units are
accompanied by instructions stating the new spec, as
well as a new label that you are directed to place over
the vehicle’s original charge spec label. But does every
tech always read all of the instructions that come in a
box with a part? And even if so, once again, will every
tech be diligent enough to affix the new label to the
system? Always be on the lookout for these types of
“outside the box” circumstances.

Incorrect Calculation of Charge

Probably the easiest error to make is calculating pounds
to ounces when there’s a decimal involved. Here’s a case
history from a Chrysler minivan with a 3.13 lb. spec. An
inexperienced tech charged 3 lbs., 13 ounces (3 lbs. x
16 for a total of 48 ounces, plus 13 equals 61 ounces)
into the system. The correct amount is 50 ounces (0.13
lb. x 16 ounces is 2.08 ounces. Add in 48 ounces and
the total is 50.08 ounces). So the results were about
an 11 ounce overcharge, high discharge pressures and a
puzzled technician.

```
Or the reverse could apply: A label in ounces and a ma-
chine with a display in pounds (with the decimal). In
this case, divide the total number of ounces by 16. Ex-
ample: 50 divided by 16 equals 3.13 lbs. If your machine
display is calibrated to a single decimal place, round off
3.13 lbs. to 3.2 lbs.
Still another calculation issue: grams and kilograms when
you have a machine in pounds and/or ounces. There are
28.4 grams per ounce, and 2.2046 pounds per kilogram.
The numbers are usually rounded off on spec labels, and if
so, you won’t have to worry about that level of accuracy.
```

```
Nissan (Maxima) label shows refrigerant capacity in pounds and
kilograms, to two decimal places, and a tolerance to three deci-
mal places.
```
```
Infiniti (M45) label shows refrigerant capacity in pounds and
kilograms, but with no tolerance listed.
```
_Don’t guess at U.S. to metric conversions. Use a calculator with
this conversion chart (or an equivalent) for easy reference. And
watch those decimal points._

Volkswagen uses grams, so if you’re converting to ounc-
es, divide by 28.4. Example: 750 grams equals 26.4
ounces (just under 26-1/2 ounces) and the tolerance
is plus (no minus) 50 grams, which equals 1.76 ounces
(just over 1-3/4 ounces). So the precise range is 26.4 to
28.16 ounces.

```

```
NOTES:

_This Volkswagen label gives refrigerant capacity in grams, along
with the plus tolerance (notice there’s no minus, so the range
is 750-800). In this case (although ounces are not listed), the
specification tolerance of 50 grams can be rounded off to two
ounces in any conversion._

```
Nissan uses pounds and kilograms, and if your machine
is calibrated in pounds, please notice that the plus/mi-
nus tolerance is just 0.055 lb., which is 0.88 ounces, less
than the 0.1 lb. on most decimal scales. Here again, take
the range and aim for something within it. The specified
charge is 1.21 lbs., so the range is 1.155 to 1.265 lbs. or
18.48 to 20.24 ounces.
Nissan is not totally consistent, at least not between the
Nissan Maxima and the Infiniti M45 labels shown below.
No tolerance is specified for Infiniti, just a single number.
It’s a good rule of thumb to have a combination of equip-
ment, and to work out a method that will always enable
you to be able to charge within 5% of the specs.

Equipment Inaccuracy

The accuracy of shop equipment is a major issue.

```
You might be using an old recovery/recycling/re-
charge machine. Its accuracy was never great in its
best days. For example, the GM ACR-4, the first dealer
recovery/recycling/recharge machine for HFC-134a
systems, had a tolerance that was later discovered
could go as high as plus/minus six ounces – a 19%
variation in a two-pound system. At one time, that
might have been close to acceptable. But since sys-
tem capacities have dropped, and tolerances with
them, you can encounter a performance problem if
you’re more than 5% off.
Your scale, after years of use with little or no main-
tenance (and probably some abuse) is likely to have
become inaccurate. Just because it’s calibrated to
one ounce or 0.1 lb. does not mean it’s accurate
to within one ounce or 1.6 ounces. There may be a
big difference between the resolution of the digital
display and the actual accuracy of the machine in
delivering a charge.
Some machines have a calibration feature for the
scale, but if nothing else, you can put 33 pen-
```
```
33 pennies weigh three ounces,
and most shops can come up with
them. They can be used to check
the scale on your recharge machine.
Place them on top of the refrigerant
tank, and check the scale reading
on the machine’s readout. If the
scale is working properly (within
tolerance), the scale reading should
show an increase in weight of at
least 0.1 lb. or two ounces, up to
0.2 lb. or three ounces. If this does
not happen, the scale needs either
calibration or replacement. Any-
thing else is not accurate enough
for charging today’s tight tolerance
systems.
As you can see, the scale on this re-
covery/recycling/recharge machine
is dead on. With 33 pennies placed
on top of its refrigerant tank, its
readout shows an increase in weight
from 34 lbs., 4 oz. to 34 lbs., 7 oz.
```
```
nies on top of the jug and see if the scale can
tell the difference. 11 pennies weigh one ounce,
so with 33, there should be an increase in weight
of at least 0.1 lb or two ounces, up to 0.2 lb.
or three ounces.
R/R/R machines that meet SAE Standard J2788 will pro-
vide more accurate refrigerant removal and charging
measurements, and provide a method for calibration of
the scale.
SAE J2788 equipment provides the following measure-
ment accuracy:
The equipment must be capable of both indicating
and recharging the system to within 15 g (0.50 oz)
of vehicle manufacturer’s specifications.
If a scale is used in the machine, its manufacturer
shall provide a method for the technician to check
scale accuracy, and include any necessary accura-
cy-checking device (such as a calibration weight(s))
with the machine.
If you are having a problem with system performance or
high system operating pressure, you may want to check
if your equipment is charging the correct amount of re-
frigerant.
```

Some technicians still attempt to use small cans and pressure
gauge readings to charge systems, but accurate charging is not
possible with this method.
```
Not Accounting for the Refrigerant Inside

the Service Hoses

A typical six-foot service hose holds approximately
two ounces of refrigerant. The use of very long service
hoses can cause a system to receive an overcharge if
procedures are not followed that take hose length into
consideration. Some charging equipment is program-
mable to allow for different hose lengths, which should
assure an accurate charge. Refer to your machine’s in-
struction manual for more information.

Technician Doesn’t Accept the Specs

It’s amazing how many shops refuse to accept the fac-
tory spec, even if there’s no bulletin to the contrary. Or
somehow, they have acquired this idea that a little more
refrigerant should be helpful. If they’re unlucky, along
with something else they do, or a part they replace, the
system cools better – in the shop – than when it came
in. Why is that unlucky? Because when it’s really hot and
the car is slow-moving in traffic, the high side pressure
goes way up and the system shuts down. Then maybe
some other shop gets the job, does a recovery and re-
charge, and enjoys a “phantom repair” at the expense of
the first shop’s reputation.

Charging Systems with Small Cans or by

Attempting to Use Pressure Readings

If you’re charging with small cans, or even using 30
pound cylinders, but trying to charge a system going by
gauge readings, or using any other method that does not
involve accurately weighing the amount of refrigerant
entering the system, **STOP!**

Pressure gauges are a diagnostic tool, but you can’t use
them to meter refrigerant into a system, and no vehicle
or system manufacturer provides exact pressure specs
for a precise charge. Even if you have reliable pressure
readings, there isn’t enough of a pressure difference to
indicate over or undercharge.
System pressure readings, whether the system is oper-
ating or off, will not identify the amount of refriger-
ant in a system. The only way to assure that any given
system’s refrigerant charge is correct is to recover all of
the existing refrigerant, perform a thorough evacuation
and install a known amount. If you have a recovery/
recycling only machine, consider purchasing an accurate
digital scale, perhaps one with a solenoid-type dispens-
ing valve.

NOTES:

Whenever you hear the term “refrigerant contamina-
tion,” the first thing you probably think of is mixed re-
frigerants. However, the most prevalent contaminant,
particularly in recycled refrigerant, is air.

This section will provide tips on dealing with both of
these problems; excessive amounts of air in refrigerant
and cross-contaminated refrigerant.

Three Questions on Air-contaminated

Refrigerant

1. What problems are caused by excess air in a vehicle air
    conditioning system?
_Air, in excess of allowable amounts, can cause the system to
operate at pressures that are higher than normal. This can
result in noisy system operation and loss of air condition-
ing performance. (Air is not a good heat transfer medium,
and higher pressures also mean higher condenser tempera-
tures, which can also degrade system performance.) It can
also cause the system’s high pressure cut out switch to in-
hibit compressor clutch operation, and/or, depending on
the circumstance, possibly cause damage to system compo-
nents due to overpressure conditions._

_The maximum acceptable amount of air contamination is
generally considered to be no more than 2%._

2. How can technicians determine if refrigerant contains
    too much air?

_The only way to determine the AMOUNT of air contained
in refrigerant is to use a refrigerant identifier. But, to de-
termine if a container of refrigerant has EXCESS air, the
following approach can be used._

```
The container must be kept at a stable temperature for
several hours before taking the readings.
Contamination can also be caused by mixed refriger-
ants which can produce readings similar to those in the
charts on page 30, mimicking air contamination. In
other words, the pressure/temperature method cannot
identify whether the higher readings are being caused
by air in the refrigerant, or if they are being caused due
to refrigerant cross-contamination.
```
**_Pressure/Temperature Method for Determining the Amount
of Air Contained Within Refrigerant in a Container_**

_To determine if a tank of recycled refrigerant contains
an excessive amount of air, the tank must be stored at
a temperature of at least 65° F for a period of 12 hours,
protected from direct sunlight. It is also advisable not to_

```
store tanks directly on the cement shop floor since the
floor temperature can affect the tank temperature. Placing
some form of insulation, such as a piece of wood between
the tank and the floor will help stabilize the tank pressure.
If these conditions have been met, a check for air may be
performed as follows:
Install a calibrated pressure gauge to the refrigerant con-
tainer (some R/R/R machines have built-in ones).
```
### Avoiding Refrigerant Contamination

```
This is a typical tank pressure gauge on a recovery/recycling ma-
chine. Its reading, with the ambient temperature reading and
Tables 1 and 2 (on page 30), can be used to determine if excess
air is in the refrigerant storage tank. If the pressure reading is
too high, air must be purged from the tank until the gauge read-
ing matches the proper one listed in the table. Still, a refriger-
ant identifier is the best tool to use to obtain a reading on the
amount of air that might be in recycled refrigerant.
```

#### © 2018 MOBILE AIR CONDITIONING SOCIETY WORLDWIDE

_To obtain the refrigerant liquid temperature, measure
the temperature of the lower one-half of the refrigerant
container’s outer surface (make sure the thermometer
is in contact with the “liquid zone” of the tank). Using
only the air temperature reading in the vicinity of the
refrigerant container can result in incorrect information._

_Compare the pressure gauge and temperature read-
ings with the limits found in Tables 1 and 2. Use the
figures in Table 1 for CFC-12, and the figures in Table
2 for HFC-134a._

_If tank pressure is below the figure listed in the table,
the refrigerant does not contain an excessive amount
of air. If tank pressure is higher than that listed in the
table for the ambient temperature, it is advisable to use
a refrigerant identifier and confirm if the high pressure
is due to excess air or cross-contamination. If it’s de-
termined to be excess air,_ **_slowly_** _vent (purge) the air
from the tank. Continue purging until tank pressure is
below that shown in the table. As the purge process is
performed, the container will cool and the tank pressure_

```
You can use the recovery/recycling/recharge machine’s air purge
valve to purge excess air from recycled refrigerant. Let the air
out, and watch the pressure gauge on the machine’s panel. When
the gauge reading reaches the appropriate number in the table
(based on the ambient temperature), close the purge valve. The
recycled refrigerant now does not contain an excessive amount of
air, and can be reused to recharge an A/C system.

If you mistakenly draw mixed refrigerant into your ser-
vice equipment, not only could it possibly damage the
equipment, but unless detected, you will contaminate
every other vehicle that you use the equipment to ser-
vice. Even a small amount of one refrigerant mixed with
another can ruin the entire batch.
Mixed refrigerants can result in elevated system operat-
ing pressures. The raising of system operating pressures
above normal can result in poor A/C performance and
could also cause damage to system components.
Mixed refrigerants cannot be separated by recycling ma-
chines and are considered hazardous waste. They must
be transported to an off-site facility for reclamation or
destruction.
```
```
Two More Issues Concerning Refrigerant
and System Contamination
Just because a vehicle is equipped with a retrofit label
and conversion fittings, it would not be wise to assume
that the refrigerant in the system is a match to the fit-
tings and the information on the label. There have also
been cases of CFC-12 systems being directly charged
with HFC-134a, with no labels, fittings, or any other
type of indication that this was done. A vehicle could
have passed through any number of hands before enter-
ing your shop, and there’s no telling what could have
happened along the way.
Also keep in mind that even approved chemicals, such as
dye or lubricant, can become contaminants if they are in
a system in excessive amounts.
```
```
will decrease. Allow the temperature to stabilize then
re-perform the check to confirm if there is still excess air
remaining in the tank.
```
**_Remember:_** _The information in the tables is only reliable
if the tank has been kept at a stable temperature for sev-
eral hours before the readings are taken, has been kept out
of direct sunlight, contains some liquid refrigerant, and
no refrigerant cross-contamination exists. It is also im-
portant that during the purge process, the tank does not
become cold, since a cold tank of refrigerant will reflect an
incorrect pressure reading. Also keep in mind that while
pressures higher than those in the charts indicate contami-
nation, they do not indicate the type of contamination (is
it air, mixed refrigerants, or a combination of both?)._

_This procedure cannot be used to determine if a mobile A/C_
**_system_** _has contamination from air or mixed refrigerant._

3. What can I do to address the problem of air in, and
    getting in, my refrigerant supply? How do I remove
    excess air from an A/C system?
_Air can be introduced into the refrigerant supply when re-
frigerant is recovered if there are any leaks in the A/C
system or the service hoses. Inspection of service equip-
ment hoses and connections is important to assure that
they are not a leak source._

_The A/C system must be checked for leaks using approved
leak detection equipment and methods. After performing re-
frigerant identification, the refrigerant must be recovered
from the system using approved and properly maintained
refrigerant recovery or recovery/recycling equipment. All sys-
tem leaks (if any) must be repaired. After all refrigeration
system service is completed, the system must be properly
evacuated (to a deep vacuum) to ensure that all air is re-
moved. Short cutting evacuation or failing to purge air from
the recovered/recycled refrigerant are two of the most com-
mon causes for air to exist in refrigerant and A/C systems.
Others are improperly operating or maintained recovery, re-
covery/recycling equipment, and vacuum pumps in need of
oil changes and/or other maintenance._

_Properly operating recycling equipment, used in accordance
with its manufacturer’s instructions, will remove excess
air from refrigerant, ensure that the maximum allowable
amount of air in recycled refrigerant is not exceeded, and
provide recycled refrigerant that is ready for use._

Mixed/Cross-contaminated Refrigerant

Mixed/cross-contaminated refrigerant is harmful for a
number of different reasons.

NOTES:


#### © 2018 MOBILE AIR CONDITIONING SOCIETY WORLDWIDE

R-What?

The potential for refrigerant cross-contamination
has been a reality for many years. Initially the
threat was viewed as being generated by a do-it-
yourselfer, or maybe even another shop, introducing
a can of the blend du jour or some illegal hydrocar-
bon cocktail into the A/C system before eventually
bringing the car to an A/C specialist for repair.

But the threat is more complicated than that. Not
only is there concern about what consumers or other
shops introduce into the A/C system, professional
shops must be vigilant about the supposedly virgin
HFC-134a they are buying and using. Counterfeit re-
frigerant has also been around for a while, but the
counterfeiters are growing in number and becoming
more sophisticated.

DuPont Refrigerants issued a press release urging
“members of the HVACR industry to increase their
awareness of, and action against, counterfeit refrig-
erant activity.

“This problem is real and it is growing, and the im-
pact can include significant injury and tragic loss of
life,” said Greg Rubin, global business manager for
DuPont Refrigerants. “Counterfeit refrigerants also
have the potential for significant business impact,
especially in emerging regions.”

All of the major refrigerant manufacturers have
stepped up efforts to combat counterfeit activ-
ity, but it seems to be an uphill battle. Gus Ro-
lotti, another industry expert, commented on that
challenge noting, “We have recently seen cylinders
that were copied almost exactly as the originals and
were filled with refrigerants other than those on
the label. Further, we have seen original, legitimate
cylinders that were fraudulently obtained from the
authorized cylinder manufacturers by a third party
and filled with low quality or other refrigerant from
what the label says. Just because the cylinder is
(or looks) authentic, is no guarantee that the re-
frigerant it contains is pure or within specs. Buyers
should indeed beware.”

Service providers should check each and every ve-
hicle before doing anything to the A/C system. They

## Counterfeit Refrigerants

```
should also check every cylinder of refrigerant be-
fore installing it on a machine.
When the pace in your shop picks up, it might be
tempting to skip that step of identifying the refrig-
erant you’re removing from the car. When times are
tough and margins tight, you might also be tempted
to go for a deal on refrigerant you find on the Inter-
net or though a friend of a friend.
Remember that your reputation is on the line with
every job you do. Take the time to identify the re-
frigerant you are working with and using, and buy
your refrigerant through a known refrigerant manu-
facturer’s authorized distributor.
In the end, it may cost you more to take short-cuts
versus taking the time to accurately identify what is
in the vehicle and what is in the container.
Counterfeits can potentially:
Prevent proper use of automated refrigerant
R/R/R equipment.
Cause internal corrosion of the A/C system, or
may destroy hoses and other plastic/rubber com-
ponents, which may allow escape of the refriger-
ant into the atmosphere, or into passenger cabin.
Cause premature equipment failures.
Void warranties on equipment.
Cause explosions or fires, if flammable/explosive
substances are used as the counterfeiting agents.
Cause serious injury or death due to violent rup-
ture of the contaminated system.
```
```
Dangerous Counterfeit HFC-134a
In 2012 there were warnings about counterfeit
HFC-134a refrigerant contaminated with significant
quantities of R-40 (aka: methyl chloride or chloro-
methane). R-40 is extremely toxic, flammable and
highly reactive when exposed to aluminum. In some
cases R-40 may react with aluminum to form a third,
highly unstable compound (trimethylaluminum or
TMA) that ignites in contact with air.
This counterfeit HFC-134a mixed with R-40 and
other refrigerants has apparently been purposely
designed to mimic pure HFC-134a at a substantially
```

#### © 2018 MOBILE AIR CONDITIONING SOCIETY WORLDWIDE

```
reduced cost, the likely motivation of the coun-
terfeiters. Refrigerant identifiers, certified to SAE
J1771, are not designed to directly identify R-40.
Some newer refrigerant identifiers, certified to SAE
J2912, are designed to recognize small amounts of
R-40 and classify it as an “Unknown” refrigerant.
Prior to issuing the warning, Neutronics Inc.’s Re-
frigerant Analysis Division had been engaged by the
oceangoing shipping industry to assist with an HFC-
134a refrigerant contamination problem involving
R-40 that resulted in three deaths in three sepa-
rate incidents. Since that time, Neutronics has been
working with the Army, which positively identified
HFC-134a contaminated with R-40 in Army depot
supplies. Ground combat and tactical vehicles ser-
viced in Afghanistan and Iraq were affected, and
while the Army does not currently know the depth
of contamination, it suspects that vehicles and re-
claimed supplies may be contaminated.
It should be noted that these contaminated refriger-
ant systems can pose a major safety issue to those
working on them. Currently the industry is working
on, but has not determined, the best service proce-
dures to be used. Contaminated systems can damage
recovery and recycling equipment, and can result in
the requirement to replace all vehicle refrigerant cir-
cuit components.
In April 2012, lab tests confirmed the presence of
R-40 in a number of containers of recovered refriger-
ant in the U.S. With the confirmation from the mili-
tary that infected vehicles have invaded our shores,
```
```
containment actions are of paramount importance.
This problem has been seen in many parts of the
world having much smaller mobile A/C fleets, so
there is the potential for the same problem in the
North American market.
While there is no reason to believe that this con-
tamination is widespread in the U.S. market, its exis-
tence serves as one more reason service shops should
remain vigilant and purchase their refrigerant from
authorized distributors of their chosen refrigerant
manufacturer.
```
```
Steps to Avoid Counterfeit Refrigerants
KNOW YOUR SUPPLIER. Obtaining refrigerant from
a trusted and well-known source that can provide
traceability is a good practice to prevent contami-
nation of equipment.
VERIFY REFRIGERANT IN CYLINDER BEFORE USING.
Proper verification of refrigerant in service cylin-
ders prior to use can ensure authenticity of the
refrigerant. Checking refrigerant cylinders with
a portable or integrated refrigerant analyzer is
mandated by SAE service standards.
VERIFY REFRIGERANT IN SYSTEMS BEFORE REPAIR-
ING/SERVICING. Proper verification of refrigerant
in systems prior to repairing and/or servicing is
imperative to safety. Testing refrigerant in systems
prior to removing the charge also prevents possible
contamination of your current (existing) supply.
```
Recovery and Disposal of Contaminated

Refrigerant

Under federal law, contaminated refrigerant cannot be
vented. Contaminated or unknown refrigerant must be
removed from a system using dedicated recovery-only
equipment, and properly disposed of.

There are currently two types of equipment that can be
used to recover contaminated refrigerant:

```
Recovery-only units offered by some equipment
manufacturers that are specifically designed for this
purpose;
You may dedicate a CFC-12 or HFC-134a recovery unit
specifically for the purpose of recovering contami-
nated refrigerant.
```
```
Caution: If the refrigerant contains flammable sub-
stances, such as propane and butane, a fire or explosion
could occur if the refrigerant is exposed to an ignition
source within the equipment. Recovery equipment that
has been certified for use with CFC-12 or HFC-134a is
not approved for use with a flammable refrigerant and
may become a safety hazard if used. Make sure you
determine if features have been incorporated into your
equipment to guard against these hazards.
Also, refrigerant containing flammable substances may
be considered hazardous, and you must follow any local,
state or federal requirements governing the storage and
disposal of ignitable materials (visit http://www.ecarcenter.org
for more information on specific disposal requirements).
```

#### © 2018 MOBILE AIR CONDITIONING SOCIETY WORLDWIDE

_Make sure new HFC-134a you intend to purchase meets the SAE
J2776 and/or the ARI 700-2006 purity standard(s), and has a
1/2-inch Acme tank fitting._

Contaminated refrigerant must be sent off-site to an EPA
certified refrigerant reclaimer for either reclamation or
destruction. A list of EPA certified refrigerant reclaimers
can be found on the EPA’s web site at _https://www.epa.
gov/section608/epa-certified-refrigerant-reclaimers._

Used Refrigerant from Non-mobile

Sources

CFC-12 and HFC-134a are also used in residential and com-
mercial refrigeration systems, such as refrigerators, wa-
ter chillers and central cooling systems. Many different
contaminants and acids may be present in refrigerant re-
covered from these systems. Automotive-type recovery/
recycling equipment will not remove these contaminants.

Refrigerant which contains acids and other contami-
nants, as well as possibly mixed refrigerants, will cause
serious problems if it is used in a mobile A/C system.

Refrigerant from non-mobile sources should not be used
unless it has been purchased from a reclamation center
which can certify that the refrigerant meets ARI 700
specifications.

Purity of New HFC-134a

In 2006, both the SAE and the ARI issued more stringent
standards concerning the purity of new HFC-134a, SAE
J2776 and ARI 700-2006.

```
Standard AHRI 700: Specification for Fluorocarbon
Refrigerants
1.1 Purpose. The purpose of this standard is to es-
tablish purity specifications, to verify composition,
and to specify the associated methods of testing for
acceptability of fluorocarbon refrigerants regardless
of source (new, reclaimed and/or repackaged) for
use in new and existing refrigeration and air condi-
tioning products within the scope of AHRI.
1.1.1 Intent. This standard is intended for the
guidance of the industry including manufacturers,
reclaimers, repackagers, distributors, installers, ser-
vicemen, contractors and users of fluorocarbon re-
frigerants.
1.1.2 Review and Amendment. This standard is
subject to review and amendment as technology ad-
vances or as additional data becomes available. This
data can be submitted to AHRI for review.
Section 2. Scope
2.1 Scope. This standard specifies acceptable levels
of contaminants (purity requirements) for fluorocar-
bon refrigerants regardless of source and lists ac-
ceptable test methods.
```
```
To meet the ARI 700-2006 and SAE J2776 purity require-
ments, “volatile impurities” shall not exceed 40 parts
per million (ppm). These impurities cannot be identi-
fied in the field, and the purity information is not nor-
mally part of the refrigerant’s Material Safety Data Sheet
(MSDS). These impurities have been identified to poten-
tially result in A/C system problems and health issues.
Refrigerant meeting SAE J2776 will have a label on the
carton and container stating: “Meets SAE J2776 purity
standard.” Containers will have 1/2-inch Acme fittings
that will attach to the automotive service equipment.
Refrigerant containers not having this fitting may not
meet the SAE J2776 purity requirements.

Field Coupling of Flexible Hose
Assemblies
SAE J2064 is an engineering standard for joint integrity
of hose couplings. This standard is important because it
covers refrigerant hoses you install or repair. Improp-
erly coupled hose assemblies are a reliability problem
and result in loss of refrigerant. With smaller refrigerant
charges, all the seals, joints and fittings have to be de-
signed to leak far less. In today’s small capacity systems,
just a few ounces lost is enough to affect performance.
And now, the systems are getting even tighter.
A MACS survey showed that half of the replacement hose
assemblies are field coupled instead of installing new
replacement assemblies. And because some of those
shops make hose assemblies for other shops, they have
a multiplier effect.
The following are some suggestions that will probably
help you do a better job.
```

#### © 2018 MOBILE AIR CONDITIONING SOCIETY WORLDWIDE

```
The conscientious shop can do a great job when it comes
to the field-assembly and repair of A/C system hoses.
```
```
Measure Twice, Crimp Once
Is your bulk A/C hose a quality brand and do you have a
hose cutter that produces a neat end?
Lube the hose end with mineral oil and insert the fitting.
Although it won’t be a difficult force fit, it shouldn’t be
drop-off loose either, even with the lubrication. The hose
end should be visible in the small inspection hole on the
side or end of the ferrule. If it isn’t visible, it isn’t fully
inserted, and you could get a poor crimp.
```
```
Appearance Counts
Inspect the crimp for a good visual appearance. It should
be uniform and the fitting itself should not be deformed.
Oblong, out-of-round or irregular crimps usually indicate
worn die carriers or a mismatch of the two dies.
If the correct hose is used with the correct fittings,
and the assembly operation is performed properly, you
should be able to build and repair hose assembles that
meet the requirements for reduced leakage.
```
```
Replacement Refrigerants and
Retrofitting Mobile A/C Systems
Retrofitting CFC-12 systems to use an alternate refrig-
erant is permitted, provided that correct procedures
are followed.
EPA regulations require that CFC-12 systems undergo-
ing retrofit must have ALL of the CFC-12 recovered, ap-
propriate conversion fittings must be installed on all of
the original CFC-12 service ports, and a new A/C system
information label must be affixed to the vehicle. The
retrofit label must include the following information:
the name and address of the technician and the com-
pany performing the retrofit; the date of the retrofit;
the trade name, and charge amount of the refrigerant
installed; and the type, manufacturer and amount of lu-
bricant used. A high-pressure compressor cut-off switch
must be installed IF the system does not already have
one AND it contains a high-pressure refrigerant relief
device. In addition, depending on the refrigerant being
used, the installation of barrier hoses on systems that
do not already have them may be required.
When retrofitting, the use of an alternate refrigerant
not approved by the system manufacturer could result
in damage to A/C system components. All mobile A/C
system manufacturers encourage the continued use of
CFC-12 in systems originally designed to use it.

```
Assembly crimped, rotated and recrimped.
```
_Incorrect tube and hose combination causing tube to seriously
deform._

Practical Matters

Typical problems with the field-coupled hoses are dam-
age to the coupling and incorrect crimping.

To assure the best field coupled hose and minimize re-
frigerant leakage, follow the hose coupling procedures
for tube and hose fit and coupling requirements as out-
lined by the supplier.

Make sure to maintain your crimper and always use the
proper dies for the particular job. Make sure that the fit-
tings and hoses are a within-tolerance fit, and that the
crimp meets the dimensions specified.

Do you just cut off the needed length of bulk hose, in-
sert the fittings and turn the crimper’s forcing screw
until the joint seems “tight enough?” If so, what you’re
doing might be producing a coupling that will leak.

A major issue is the hose, which has greater size toler-
ances than the metal fittings. There are cases where the
wrong-size fitting has been inserted - so loose that if
you inverted the hose, the fitting might drop off. We
also know of shops that believe “one crimper fits all”
and use a hydraulic hose crimper on an A/C hose. It may
produce a tight crimp, but it’s been known to crack the
hose’s barrier lining.

Retrofit requirements and recommendations may in-
clude the installation of new o-rings and/or seals, new
desiccant, a different lubricant, replacement of refrig-
erant controls, increased condenser capacity and other
modifications. Not following OEM recommendation may
result in system damage, loss of performance and could
also affect component warranties. Additional informa-
tion on retrofits can be found at the following link:

What About Retrofitting HFC-134a

Systems?

HFC-134a systems are designed and tested only for use
with HFC-134a and PAG or POE lubricant. There is no
published information or industry-recognized tests to
establish system cooling performance, system reliabil-
ity, material compatibility or the potential for chemi-
cal damage to the system’s lubricant, seals and hoses
should a substitute refrigerant be installed in an HFC-
134a system.

The new alternative refrigerants, HFC-152a, R-744 (CO 2 )
and HFO-1234yf, are only approved by EPA for use in new

```
vehicles. A system designed to use HFC-134a cannot be
retrofitted to use any of these refrigerants.
A Word on Flammable Refrigerants
Replacement refrigerants which are or can become flam-
mable have been sold for use in mobile A/C systems. CFC-
12 and HFC-134a A/C systems are not designed to use
flammable refrigerants, and using a flammable refriger-
ant as a replacement for CFC-12 is prohibited by federal
law. EPA has explicitly listed any flammable substitute,
besides HFC-152a and HFO-1234yf, as unacceptable under
SNAP. Caution should be taken before working on any
system suspected of containing flammable refrigerant;
some electronic leak detectors could become an ignition
source if being used to find leaks in a system contain-
ing flammable refrigerant; components inside many re-
covery/recycling machines can also serve as a possible
ignition source if the equipment is being used to recover
flammable refrigerant. Either of these situations could
result in a fire or explosion.
Connection and disconnection of service equipment of-
ten results in the release of a small amount of refriger-
ant at the service ports. If the refrigerant released in
these circumstances is flammable, and there is a source
of ignition nearby, a fire or explosion could occur.
WARNING: REMOVAL AND HANDLING OF FLAMMABLE RE-
FRIGERANTS MAY BE DANGEROUS.
```
```
The U.S. EPA’s Significant New
Alternatives Policy (SNAP)
Under the Significant New Alternatives Policy (SNAP),
in addition to HFC-134a, the EPA has accepted other al-
ternate refrigerants. Refer to Tables 3 through 6 on the
following pages for additional information from EPA on
these alternatives.
```
_Even though a CFC-12 system may be equipped with a retrofit
label and conversion fittings, that doesn’t provide “proof” of the
type of refrigerant that may be in the system, or its purity. The
only way to know for sure is to connect a refrigerant identifier to
the system and take a reading._

## Best Service Practices for HFO-1234yf Systems

### Introduction

NOTES:


#### © 2018 MOBILE AIR CONDITIONING SOCIETY WORLDWIDE

Besides following all of the GENERAL safety procedures,
HFO-1234yf has additional SPECIFIC safety require-

1. HFO-1234yf is classed by ASHRAE as **_A2L – Mildly Flammable_**. It can ignite under certain circumstances. Always
    follow these steps before working with this chemical:
    A. Insure good ventilation in the work area and do not allow the refrigerant to pool in or under the vehicle, or
       in any low area such as a stairwell or pit. Keep car doors and windows open when charging the A/C system
       to prevent an accumulation of refrigerant in case of a major refrigerant leak.
    B. Remove ALL sources of sparks, flame or high heat from the immediate work area. This may include non-A/C
       related equipment such as grinders, welders, dryers and similar equipment. Some common shop tools contain
       electric motors or switches which spark internally; move this equipment to a safer area. Remember also that
       a vehicle’s ignition system can produce external sparks under some conditions – take great care to prevent
       arcing and accidental grounding of electrical circuits.
    C. Use LED work lights to prevent the risk of a broken bulb in the work area.
    D. Do not smoke or permit smoking anywhere in or near the work area.
    E. Keep well-maintained fire extinguishers in the work area and know how to use them.
2. Avoid contact with liquid or gaseous refrigerant. Always wear personal protective equipment (PPE) during ser-
    vice, particularly goggles with side panels, and gloves (impermeable to refrigerant). Exposure of the skin to
    refrigerant may result in frostbite, in which case rub the affected area with lukewarm water. A physician shall
    be consulted immediately regarding the affected skin areas.
    A. A physician shall be consulted immediately in the event of complaints following exposure to high refriger-
       ant concentrations. Complaint symptoms may include: Increased breathing rate, breathlessness, headache,
       accelerated pulse, dizziness.
3. Do not store refrigerant tanks in low areas such as basements or stairwells and do not transport tanks without
    securing them.
4. If the vehicle uses hybrid or all-electric propulsion, follow the correct procedure to de-activate the high volt-
    age electrical system before beginning repairs. Note that these de-activation procedures may require additional
    personal protective equipment.
5. Prevent accidental release and exposure to refrigerant — only connect service equipment when high-side pres-
    sures have decreased, usually after the engine and compressor have been off for three minutes or more.
6. Do not allow anyone under the vehicle while recharging the system. Unexpected refrigerant leakage or a sud-
    den release of the pressure valve will pool refrigerant near the ground. Always maintain good ventilation in the
    work area.
7. HFO-1234yf may only be used in systems specifically designed for it. Do not use this refrigerant in older cars,
    and do not use different refrigerants in a car designed for HFO-1234yf.
8. Each machine or device used to service a system with HFO-1234yf must be designed and approved for use with
    a flammable gas. Do not attempt to use equipment designed for other refrigerants on this system.
9. Read the label on the vehicle and know the correct amount of refrigerant to return into the system after
    evacuation.
10. Order the correct repair parts. Evaporators for HFO-1234yf systems are not the same as those used with HFC-
    134a, and other system components may be different as well.
11. You are responsible for the work you perform. Do not put your customers at risk with faulty, incorrect or quick-
    fix repairs.

```
ments. To work safely with this chemical, a technician
must know and follow these procedures.
```
### HFO-1234yf: Specific Safety Procedures


#### © 2018 MOBILE AIR CONDITIONING SOCIETY WORLDWIDE

The refrigerant HFO-1234yf is similar to, but not the
same as, HFC-134a.

HFO-1234yf has been listed under EPA’s SNAP as accept-
able, subject to use conditions, for use in new vehicles;
the refrigerant was not listed as acceptable for retrofit.
The use conditions for HFO-1234yf include compliance
with SAE J639, and manufacturers must conduct Fail-
ure Mode and Effect Analysis (FMEA) as provided in SAE
J1739. (Additional information may be found in 40 CFR
82, subpart G, appendix B.) The new system designs will
include some new components and materials.

Risks and Hazards

The primary difference between this refrigerant and
HFC-134a is its flammability, and care must always be
taken concerning this hazard. However, technicians work
with and around a variety of flammable materials every
day including fuels, lubricants, welding gases and other
materials. Common sense and safe shop practices can
greatly reduce any hazard from this gas.

To become flammable in an enclosed area (such as a ve-
hicle’s cabin), the mixture of air and refrigerant must
contain between 6.5% and 12.3% of the chemical va-
por. Additionally, the mixture then requires a significant
amount of energy to ignite—in some laboratory tests a
spark similar to a direct short at the battery did not ignite
the mixture. Other tests showed that a typical static dis-
charge will not have sufficient energy to ignite the refrig-
erant. It is difficult to ignite, but not impossible.

Because of its flammability, and the possibility of re-
frigerant build-up in the passenger area from a leaking
evaporator, manufacturers are being very careful in their
system design. The industry has agreed to use special
stronger evaporators in these systems. These units pro-
vide increased protection against corrosion and bursting
and are also more resistant to pinhole leakage.

The increased performance specifications for evapora-
tors are explained in SAE Standard J2842. It requires
all evaporators for HFO-1234yf systems, both original
equipment and replacement, to have a permanent mark-
ing (label, stamp, or etching) indicating the refrigerant
for which it was designed and that the evaporator design
meets the requirements of SAE J2842. **(Note: Only new
evaporators should be used in CO 2 systems, as well.)**

Also note that it is unsafe to attempt any shop repair
on a leaking evaporator – it should always be replaced
with a correct, new unit to maintain occupant safety.

### Unique Properties of HFO-1234yf Systems

#### SAFETY IS IMPORTANT

```
Read the Material Safety Data Sheet (MSDS) for HFO-
1234yf. The MSDS gives details of how to handle
problems, including accidental inhalation, spills and
fires. MSDS and product safety sheets are available
from many sources, including your refrigerant sup-
plier or on the Internet.

```
Standard J2844: R-1234yf (HFO-1234yf) New Re-
frigerant Purity and Container Requirements for
Use in Mobile Air Conditioning Systems
Issuing Committee: SAE International Interior Climate
Control Fluids Committee
This SAE Standard applies to new refrigerant used in
motor vehicle passenger air conditioning (A/C) sys-
tems designed to use R-1234yf, including belt and
electrically driven compressors. Refrigerant for use
in hermetically sealed, refrigerated cargo systems is
not covered by this document.
```
```
The re-use of a salvage or used evaporator from anoth-
er vehicle may be dangerous and is not recommended,
although a refrigerant control device such as a thermal
expansion valve (TXV) or block valve may be reused if
it is serviceable.
As these systems are developed and refined by their man-
ufacturers, other components may also change including
hose materials and desiccants. Always be very careful to
order correct replacement parts for these systems.

PURCHASE, STORAGE, AND TRANSPORT
All compressed gas in cylinders or portable tanks must
be stored, handled and transported in accordance with
the Compressed Gas Association Pamphlet P-1. Storage
of multiple containers of refrigerant may be subject to
local, state or federal rules or regulations.
Refrigerant cylinders must not be: exposed to direct sun-
light or any other heat source; subject to mechanical stress
resulting from dropping or throwing; stored in below ground
areas or in front of cellar windows; filled in the workshop
by workshop personnel; filled with another refrigerant; or
transported without being securely stowed.
In general, do not expose any compressed gas cylinders
(HFC-134a, HFO-1234yf, CO 2 , etc.) to temperatures in ex-
cess of 52 degrees C (125 degrees F), as this will result
in cylinders becoming liquid full.
Rules from the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT)
already cover transporting flammable compressed gas-
ses. In general, they affect large shipments by truck, rail,
ocean or air. However, shops and suppliers who transport
more than a few refrigerant containers at a time should
review the DOT rules to see if any changes will be needed.
```
```
Similarities to HFC-134a
Although HFO-1234yf is not the same as HFC-134a, it is
similar in many ways. As a refrigerant, it works at almost
the same temperatures and pressures as HFC-134a.
Vapor pressures for the two refrigerants are very similar.
A technician will find that many present diagnostic pro-
cedures, such as measuring inlet and outlet tempera-
tures at the condenser, will produce familiar results in
these systems.
Industry tests showed that PAG oil is satisfactory for
use with HFO-1234yf. PAG oil does not damage plastic or
elastomeric components like the seals, connectors and
o-rings used in an air conditioning system. The correct
amount and type of oil will be determined by each ve-
hicle or system manufacturer and may be shown on a
label under the hood.
However, not all vehicles will use PAG oil. Many hybrids
and other vehicles with electric compressors require a
POE or other oil. Always check for the label to learn the
correct TYPE of oil and then use the correct AMOUNT of
oil during repair.

Hybrids and EVs
Many hybrid and electric vehicles use air condition-
ing compressors operated by high voltage. These
types of vehicles usually incorporate a device to
disconnect high voltage from the air conditioning
system components. Before performing service on
these systems, follow the vehicle manufacturer’s
recommended safety procedures. Not doing so could
result in serious injury or death.

Note: Proper operation of the mobile air conditioning and cooling systems in a hybrid vehicle is important not only for
passenger comfort, but for the optimal operation of on-board computers and battery packs.

### Tanks, Labels, and Fittings

Refrigerant Tanks

Tanks containing HFC-134a are light blue in color. Tanks
and containers of HFO-1234yf are identified by informa-
tion on printed labels and by the color and design of the
container itself. To prevent confusion, HFO-1234yf con-
tainers will be white with a red stripe or band. The red
is used to remind users that the product is flammable.

```
The refrigerant label is easy to find on the 2013 Cadillac XTS but
you may have to look around on other vehicles.

```
Note that, at the left of the label, the triangle and excla-
mation mark is the international symbol for a hazard. The
center symbol indicates that the product is flammable,
and the last one shows that special training is required to
use this product. (The worker has a small medal or ribbon
denoting completed training.)
Across the top are the symbols for “keep hands clear” and
automatic fan(s) plus a warning that injury can occur –
note the severed fingers! The last symbol directs techni-
cians to consult “Information” in the service manual.

Refrigerant Labels

**CONTAINERS**

The label and printed matter on the refrigerant container
will identify the contents and provide limited emergency
response information, including telephone numbers for
use in an emergency. There are also directions for safe
storage and handling of the chemical and other infor-
mation. Note that the company may also display a trade
name for the product and the names may be very different
between companies. Always check that the tank contains
HFO-1234yf and not another refrigerant.

**VEHICLES**

U.S. law requires every vehicle manufacturer to provide
a standard label identifying the type and quantity of re-
frigerant used in the vehicle’s air conditioning system and
also the type of compressor lubricant (oil) used.

The label is always located in the engine compartment
and is frequently on a crossmember near the radiator, or
on the underside of the hood.

erant and the type of lubricating oil (oil lamp symbol).
Note that the amount of refrigerant may be indicated
in kilograms, grams, ounces or pounds-and-ounces. De-
pending on your service equipment, you may have to
perform mathematical conversions of the units before
performing repairs and recharging.

Fittings

The law requires that the service fittings (“ports”) and
connectors be unique for each refrigerant used. This re-
quirement prevents contamination by assuring that ser-
vice equipment for one refrigerant will not connect to
a system using a different chemical. The rule applies
to connections on supply tanks, service tools and the
vehicle itself.

Most vehicle air conditioning systems have two service
ports – HI pressure and LO pressure – while others have

```
only one. You may find the same thing on vehicles using
HFO-1234yf refrigerant, but the service ports for these
vehicles are different in size, shape and thread patterns
from those on older systems.
The service ports on HFO-1234yf vehicles also still use
the protective external caps, but the caps are new and
use the new diameter and threads.
Your service and test equipment and the refrigerant
tanks must have the correct connectors to match and
connect to the vehicle. You will have to purchase new
equipment (manifold gauges, recovery machines, etc.)
to service HFO-1234yf refrigerant systems.
Do NOT attempt to connect older or incorrect equipment
to these systems. Forcing a connector into place or us-
ing any type of adapter is not safe and is illegal.
```
### Identifying HFO-1234yf

Technicians must always identify the refrigerant in a
system before any other work is performed. It is criti-
cally important to keep refrigerants separated and to
prevent contamination in both the vehicle and in your
shop equipment. Mixing refrigerants, even accidentally,
can lead to improper system pressures, system and com-
ponent damage, diagnostic errors, and hazards to people
and the environment.

Start by checking the refrigerant label to learn what
should be in the system. Then connect the identifier to
learn what is in the system. Remember that labels may
be missing and owners may install adapters and other
refrigerants.

A vehicle may also have been repaired with incorrect
or impure refrigerant during mechanical or body shop
repairs, or even by an owner trying to save some money.
An identifier can prevent harmful chemicals from enter-
ing your shop equipment. You can also use the tool to
double-check what is in a tank of refrigerant.

SAE J2843 requires that all recovery/recycle/recharge
machines built for use with HFO-1234yf have either an
integrated refrigerant identifier that complies with SAE
J2927 or shall be capable of receiving input from a non-
integrated, SAE J2912 compliant identifier, via an inte-
grated USB port.

Identifiers are simple to use. Some detect certain refrig-
erants, while others are capable of sensing many gases.
Naturally, you need a refrigerant identifier that is ca-
pable of detecting HFO-1234yf.

```
Neutronics, Inc. refrigerant identifier
```
```
If you already have a refrigerant identifier for other re-
frigerants, it is unlikely that it can be updated to also
identify HFO-1234yf. You will need a new unit. When
you purchase a refrigerant identifier (which is not part
of a recovery/ recycle/ recharge machine) make certain
it meets the specifications of SAE J2912. That document
establishes criteria for the identifier’s level of sensing
accuracy and other functions.
Keep in mind that even the best identifier may not be
able to identify all of the possible combinations of
chemicals that could be in an A/C system or storage
tank.

```
them from damage. Any detector you purchase should
meet the performance requirements of SAE Standard
J2913, which insures the tool (when set to its most sen-
sitive mode) will be able to detect a leak as small as 0.15
ounces per year.
```
```
WARNING
If your refrigerant identifier shows an indication of
“HC” or “hydrocarbon,” take extra caution.
These gases, (propane, butane, or others) are highly
flammable and explosive. Take extreme care to con-
tain these chemicals properly and recover them with-
out leakage, using appropriate equipment.
```
Refrigerant identifiers are delicate electronic tools. They
should be used carefully, stored properly and given peri-
odic service to maintain their operation.

Connect the refrigerant identifier according to instruc-
tions that came with it. You may need to allow a bit of
time for the unit to perform an internal calibration.

After the identifier samples the refrigerant, it will re-
port the results. Some tools give only a Pass-Fail in-
dication while others will report the percentages of

REMEMBER
Always identify the refrigerant in every system before
beginning work.
```
### Finding Leaks

Electronic Leak Detectors

Make certain that your leak detector will recognize and
react to HFO-1234yf.

Electronic leak detectors are sold under many brand
names and use different methods to detect refrigerant.
They require maintenance and careful use to protect

```
chemicals found. Identifiers that meet the SAE speci-
fication look for at least 98% concentration before re-
porting that the refrigerant is “pure.” If the identifier
shows “Fail” or reports mixtures of refrigerants, the
system must be evacuated into a “junk” tank, not the
regular supply tanks of refrigerant.

### Using Recovery, Recycling, and Recharging Equipment

_The certification label shows the standards the unit meets and
that the machine is for HFO-1234yf only (Courtesy Robinair)._

```
Prior to operating the R/R/R machine, the technician
will need to identify the vehicle or its refrigerant capac-
ity by entering the data through the machine’s keyboard.
```
Basic Rules

1. Every tool or machine used to service or repair an
    HFO-1234yf system MUST be approved for use with
    that refrigerant.
2. Fittings and connectors for HFO-1234yf are different
    from any other refrigerant.

Equipment Certification

Equipment for HFO-1234yf has been designed to safely
handle flammable gas, and this equipment is NOT the
same as equipment for other refrigerants.

For HFO-1234yf, recovery/recycling/recharge equipment
must meet SAE Standard J2843 or J3030. Recovery-only
units must meet SAE Standard J2851. Always use equip-
ment that meets these standards.

**WHY IT’S IMPORTANT**

Since HFO-1234yf A/C systems use a different refriger-
ant, some steps and processes for servicing the system
are different from other refrigerants. In all cases, the
refrigerant MUST be recovered.

A/C System Recharge

Recovery and recharge equipment for HFO-1234yf repre-
sents a new generation of tools. The equipment is de-
signed to prevent refrigerant leakage by checking the
system under both vacuum and pressure.

If a leak is detected, the equipment will continue to
hold for further external leak checking, and will lock
out all operations except recovery and/or re-evacuation.
If the vacuum decay and pressurized leak checks are
passed, then the balance of the programmed amount
will be charged.
Extra care should be taken to avoid significant over-
charging of the refrigerant system.
```
```
Critical Charges
HFO-1234yf systems use much less refrigerant than old-
er systems, and are less tolerant of incorrect amounts.
HFO-1234yf systems are designed to work best with a
specific amount of refrigerant. More is NOT better, and a
larger charge will not make the system cool better.
Although most recharging will be done with automatic
equipment, mistakes are still possible and technicians
must take every care to be accurate.
Undercharges can result in poor cooling and poor lubri-
cant circulation in the compressor. Too much refriger-
ant or overcharging can cause high operating pressures,
and poor cooling in the cabin.

```
_You will need a new R/R/R machine just for HFO-1234yf. Some are available now and more will enter the market soon._

Before delivering a full system charge, equipment used
to recharge R-1234yf systems will first place the system
under a minimum vacuum of -0.09 MPa gauge (26.9 in
of mercury). The machine will then monitor the applied
vacuum, and note if it decays. If the slope of the vacuum
decay exceeds 51mm Hg/min (2.0 in HG/min) in five min-
utes, a leak is indicated and the machine will not permit
the recharge process to continue. The technician shall
locate and repair the leak(s) before again attempting to
recharge the system.

If the system passes the vacuum decay check, the ma-
chine will instruct the user to turn the vehicle’s HVAC
blower motor on low (A/C off), with air distribution
mode set to “floor,” to run the blower for 1-2 minutes
to clear any residual contamination, and to place an op-
erating J2913 compliant leak detector’s probe, with the
unit set for maximum sensitivity, in the center of a floor
ducts outlet.

The machine will require the user to verify that the leak
detector is in place and the blower motor is on low. If
“No,” the machine will not allow user to continue.

If “Yes,” the machine will charge 15% of the refrigerant
system charge specified on the SAE J639 vehicle label,
into both the high and low sides of the system. The
user will be required to monitor the J2913 leak detector
for 5 minutes for indication of a leak. The machine will
require the user to indicate if a leak is detected or not.

### System Servicing Procedures.

### EPA SNAP Rules

Working with HFO-1234yf is not difficult, but it is dif-
ferent from many procedures you already know. At all
times, the secrets to success are knowledge and safety.

Remember the Basics:

```
Learn and follow the safety procedures for storage
and handling of HFO-1234yf. Anticipate problems
and eliminate them.
All refrigerant (except CO 2 ) must be recovered. Re-
frigerant oil must also be recovered and disposed of
according to all federal, state and local rules.
Prevent contamination of refrigerants by using the
proper equipment on each vehicle. Always identify
refrigerants in a system before beginning any other
work or connecting other equipment.
Have the correct equipment before beginning. Any
equipment connected to an HFO-1234yf system must
be rated or approved for use with a flammable gas.
```
```
Any component used to repair an HFO-1234yf air
conditioning system MUST be rated or approved for
use with that refrigerant. Substituting other com-
ponents may present a hazard to vehicle occupants.
For occupant safety, always replace failed evapo-
rators with new units specifically designed for the
task and complying with SAE J2842. Never attempt
to repair a leaking HFO-1234yf evaporator or replace
it with a used (salvage) unit.
Always replace o-rings and seals with new pieces.
Reusing old parts usually causes leaks.
Take care to align the components when mating fit-
tings and seals. Mount all components and lines
securely to eliminate vibration and rubbing.
Always tighten threaded fittings to the correct
torque value given by the manufacturer.
```
2016 EPA SNAP Update

On September 26, 2016, US EPA finalized rules that will
reduce the projected growth and emissions of HFCs. They
affect Section 608 of the Clean Air Act, which extends
the ODS (Ozone Depleting Substance) sales restriction
to HFCs and other non-exempt substitutes, with the ex-
ception of small cans containing two pounds or less of
(primarily) HFC-134a for servicing motor vehicle air con-
ditioners. These small cans can continue to be sold with-
out technician certification so long as the small cans
have a self-sealing valve to reduce refrigerant leakage.
It also applies to other non-ozone depleting substitutes

```
such as R-1234yf, the new HFO that’s quickly becoming
the replacement of choice for car and light truck manu-
facturers around the world due to its lower GWP (global
warming potential).
The rule also lists HFO-1234yf as acceptable, subject
to use conditions, for limited HD vehicle types, such as
medium-duty passenger vehicles, HD pickup trucks and
complete HD vans. It allows the use of yf in newly manu-
factured medium and heavy duty vehicles with a GVWR
of between 8,500 and 14,000 pounds (Classes 2b and 3)
that are built with an air conditioning system designed
to use R-1234yf.

## REFRIGERANT RECYCLING AND SERVICE PROCEDURES FOR

## MOBILE AIR CONDITIONING TECHNICIANS

Before the 1990s, it was common practice during the
service of mobile air conditioning systems to just add
refrigerant to leaking systems. It was also common prac-
tice to vent the entire refrigerant charge to the atmo-
sphere if the refrigeration system required any type of
service which involved opening the refrigerant circuit.
These practices were acceptable because refrigerant was
relatively inexpensive and thought to be environmen-
tally benign.

But, knowing what we do today about the role of CFC-12
in the degradation of the earth’s protective ozone layer,
and the potential of global warming, venting refriger-
ants is irresponsible and is not permitted. Under the
Clean Air Act, this activity is illegal; the EPA prohibits
the venting of all mobile A/C refrigerants, except CO 2.

### The Historical Context

### Ozone Depletion

Ozone is a pungent, slightly blue gas that absorbs certain
wavelengths of the sun’s radiation. Ozone is concentrat-
ed in a part of the atmosphere called the stratosphere.
The stratosphere is located between 10 and 30 miles
above the earth’s surface.

The ozone layer acts as a shield against harmful solar Ultra-
violet Beta (UVB) radiation. Ozone normally absorbs UVB.
Decreasing the amount of stratospheric ozone results in
higher levels of UVB reaching the earth’s surface, and this
increase can be harmful to humans, animals, plants, and
the environment as a whole. It is estimated that for every
percentage point that stratospheric ozone is reduced, ex-
posure to ultraviolet radiation is increased by 1.5 to 2%.

Substances like chlorine, from synthetic chemicals called
chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), and bromine, from chemi-
cals called halons, when released to the atmosphere,
react in a way which reduces the amount of ozone in
the stratosphere. CFCs were used as blowing agents in
plastic foam products (cushioning, insulation and pack-
aging), as refrigerants, as solvents, as sterilants, and in
aerosol applications. Additionally, halons are used as fire
extinguishing agents.

Growing awareness about the threat to the global envi-
ronment, and the type and amount of refrigerant used

```
CFCs were used for many different purposes, including refriger-
ants in mobile A/C systems prior to about 1992. Leaks and other
releases allow them to enter the atmosphere.
```
```
To protect the ozone layer, the United States, and over
180 other nations ratified the 1987 Montreal Protocol on
Substances which Deplete the Ozone Layer. This land-
mark international agreement is designed to control the
production and consumption of certain chlorofluorocar-
bon and halon compounds.
Before the early 1990s, mobile air conditioning systems
used CFC-12 refrigerant. With the advent of the Montreal
Protocol, the industry changed to HFC-134a. In 1990,
the U.S. Clean Air Act addressed the refrigerants used in
mobile air conditioning systems.
CFC-12 has both an Ozone Depletion Potential (ODP) and
Global Warming Potential (GWP). HFC-134a is not ozone-
depleting, but is considered to have global warming po-
tential. By late 1994, all new mobile air conditioning
systems produced in the United States used HFC-134a.
```

in mobile air conditioning systems, resulted in system
design changes, and new service procedures and equip-
ment to reduce system lifetime emissions.

```
The ozone layer is located in the stratosphere about 10 to 30
miles (16 to 48 kilometers) above the earth’s surface.
```
CFCs and their Effect on Ozone

Possible depletion of the ozone layer from CFCs was
first reported in 1974. Research indicated that chlorine
released from CFCs could migrate to the stratosphere
and destroy ozone molecules (Molina and Rowland,
1974).

Some CFCs have an atmospheric lifetime of more than
120 years (which means they do not break down in the
lower atmosphere). As a result, they migrate slowly to
the stratosphere where radiation from sunlight strikes
them, releasing chlorine.

In the stratosphere, these chemicals absorb UV radia-
tion, break apart, and react with ozone, taking away one
oxygen atom and forming chlorine monoxide. Chlorine
monoxide further breaks down ozone by pulling away
a single oxygen atom, creating two oxygen molecules.

Once freed, the chlorine acts as a catalyst, repeatedly
combining with, and breaking apart ozone molecules. It
is believed that one CFC molecule can destroy as many as
100,000 ozone molecules.

Because of the long atmospheric lifetimes of CFCs, it
will take many decades for the ozone layer to return to
its former concentration. As CFC levels are reduced, the
natural atmospheric process will rebuild the ozone level.

```
Chlorine atoms from CFCs break apart ozone molecules. This re-
sults in a reduction of stratospheric ozone.
```
```
1) In the upper atmosphere, ultraviolet light breaks off
a chlorine atom from a chlorofluorocarbon molecule.
```
```
2) The chlorine attacks an ozone molecule, breaking it
apart. An ordinary oxygen molecule and a molecule
of chlorine monoxide are formed.
```
```
3) A free oxygen atom breaks up the chlorine monoxide
molecule. The chlorine atom is then free to repeat
the process.

Until that time, increased UV levels can lead to a greater

Health and Environmental Effects

The Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) assess-
ment of the risks from ozone depletion has focused on
the following issues:

```
Increases in skin cancers
Increases in cataracts
Damage to the human immune system
Damage to crops
Damage to aquatic organisms
```
Other Impacts

**Degradation of Polymers** - Ozone depletion accelerates
weathering (i.e. chalking, yellowing, and cracking) of
plastics used in outdoor applications.

**Climate Change** - CFCs (and HFCs as well) are green-
house gases which contribute to global warming and ris-
ing sea levels.

Global Problem
Ozone protection is a global concern. CFCs and halons
have been produced in the United States, and in other
countries, and are still being used in nations around the
world. Given their long atmospheric lifetimes, they have
become widely dispersed over time. As a result, the re-
lease of these chemicals by one country can migrate up
into the stratosphere, travel globally and adversely af-
fect the health and welfare of other countries.
The United States, for example, was one of the larg-
est producers and consumers of CFCs. Other nations also
have been significant users.
Therefore, to protect the ozone layer, an international
solution was critical.
```
```
Montreal Protocol
Recognizing the global nature of the problem, on Sep-
tember 16, 1987, in Montreal, Canada, 24 nations and the
European Economic Community (EEC) signed the Montreal
Protocol on Substances which Deplete the Ozone Layer.
The U.S. and other countries signing the Protocol agreed
to phase out production of ozone-depleting substances.
The 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments incorporated the Pro-
tocol’s original phase-out date: the year 2000. In 1992,
President George H. W. Bush pledged to halt almost all
U.S. production of CFCs by the end of 1995.
```
```
AMENDMENT TO ADDRESS HFCs UNDER THE
MONTREAL PROTOCOL
On October 15, 2016, 197 countries adopted an amend-
ment to phase down HFCs under the Montreal Protocol in
Kigali, Rwanda. Under the amendment, countries com-
mitted to cut the production and consumption of HFCs
by more than 80 percent over the next 30 years. The
ambitious phase down schedule will avoid more than 80
billion metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent emis-
sions by 2050—avoiding up to 0.5° Celsius warming by
the end of the century—while continuing to protect the
ozone layer. The US and other developed countries will
reduce HFC consumption beginning in 2019 and freeze
consumption in 2024, with a small number of developing
countries freezing consumption in 2028.

## Important Dates

```
Jan. 1, 1992: Since this date, containment and
recycling of CFC-12 and HCFC refrigerants has
been required.
Nov. 15, 1992: Since this date, sales of contain-
ers of CFCs under 20 pounds to anyone other than
certified Section 609 technicians has been pro-
hibited.
Nov. 14, 1994: Since this date, the sale of ozone-
depleting refrigerants in any size container is re-
stricted to certified technicians.
July 1995: Since this date, any CFC-12 mobile air
conditioning system that is converted (retrofit-
ted) to use an EPA accepted alternate refrigerant
must have installed the appropriate unique ser-
vice fittings and label listed for that refrigerant.
Nov. 15, 1995: Since this date Section 608 of the
Clean Air Act (the Act) prohibits individuals from
knowingly venting substitutes* for CFC and HCFC
refrigerants during the maintenance, service, re-
pair and disposal of air conditioning and refrig-
eration equipment.
January 1, 2018: Starting on this date, the sale
of ODS and substitute refrigerant is restricted to
certified technicians.
It must be noted that the above regulations ap-
ply no matter where a system is undergoing service,
whether it be in a shop, or at an “off-site” location,
such as a farm field, construction site, parking lot,
etc. Approved recovery-only, or recovery/recycling
equipment can, and must be used any time refriger-
ant must be removed from a system for any reason.
*CO 2 is exempt from this venting prohibition.
```
The Chemicals

Listed below are chemicals and their associated ODP
(Ozone Depletion Potential) values as well as their
GWP (Global Warming Potential) values. An ODP value
is a measure of a chemical’s relative ability to destroy
ozone molecules in the stratosphere. A GWP is a mea-
sure of a chemical’s relative ability to produce a global
warming effect.

The higher the ODP value, the greater a chemical’s potential
to destroy ozone in the stratosphere. The higher the GWP
value, the greater a chemical’s influence on global warming.

Tax on CFC-12

On January 1 of each year, businesses with an inventory,
or floor stock, of 400 pounds of CFC-12 or more, are re-
quired to report their inventory and pay the difference
between the prior year tax rate per pound. Each year,
the floor tax increases 45 cents on each pound of refrig-
erant in stock. (Refrigerant recycled on-site from mobile
A/C systems is not taxable.)

The floor stock tax on ozone-depleting chemicals is due
and payable without assessment or notice on or before
June 30.

If a businesses’ inventory is 399 pounds or less, no tax
payment is required. If inventory is 400 pounds or more,
tax is required on all of the refrigerant – the first 399
pounds is not exempted.

**_Note: Consult your tax advisor for additional information._**

CFC-12 Possession and Use

It is legal to store and use CFC-12 for servicing mobile
A/C systems. However, only technicians certified under
section 608 or 609 of the Clean Air Act may purchase it.

mobile A/C system service, visit _https://www.epa.gov/
