## Cleanliness and Maple Syrup Quality.

The most important contributor to
maple syrup quality is cleanliness.
Microorganisms, bacteria and yeast are
enemies of high quality syrup. They
affect both color and flavor. Since these
culprits are found on unclean equipment,
and may grow rapidly in sap and
syrup, careful sanitary practices are
critical when you collect sap, and make,
pack and store syrup.

## Sanitizers and Maple Syrup Quality.

Although cleanliness is a “must,”
most cleaning compounds cannot be
used in maple production. Household
detergents, and soaps that have any
fragrance, and iodine-based dairy
sanitizers should not be used to sanitize
syrup production equipment. They can
ruin syrup flavor, making the syrup
unsaleable.

One part unscented household
chlorine bleach (such as unscented
Clorox™) to 20 parts of clean water may
be used for rinsing, but you’ll need to
flush equipment afterwards with clean,
clear water. Don’t use a stronger
solution, or let the solution stand in
galvanized equipment, because flavor
problems may result.

**Caution! Household chlorine
bleach is generally a 5.25 percent
sodium hypochlorite solution.
Commercial bleaches are stronger. The
“one part bleach to 20 parts water”
noted in this manual refers to
household bleach.**

Remember that anything added to
sap, even in minute quantities, will
become concentrated as the sap is
boiled to syrup, causing an off-flavor.
Plenty of “elbow grease” and lots of

```
clean, hot water are the best cleaning
agents for maple syrup equipment.
```
## Quality Begins in the Sugarbush.

```
The equipment you use will also
have a big impact on your final product.
Don’t use rusty or corroded spouts,
buckets, or other maple utensils.
Otherwise you may find toxic metals
and metallic off-flavors in your syrup.
```
### Spouts.

```
Before using spouts, sanitize them.
First, clean them and dip-rinse them in
a chlorine bleach solution (one part of
unscented chlorine bleach to 20 parts of
water). Then rinse them thoroughly in
hot water. (As a substitute for the dip-
rinse, metal spouts may be boiled in
clean water.) A sanitized spout will
keep the tap hole open longer, increasing
sap yield, and will help to keep tubing
lines free of microorganisms.
```
### Buckets and Pails.

```
Scrub buckets and pails thoroughly
by hand or by machine with hot water.
If you use a chlorine bleach solution to
sanitize them (one part unscented
household chlorine bleach to 20 parts
water), take care to rinse each bucket
well. Do this at the end of the season so
next year’s work is easier, and to
prevent metal deterioration.
```
## Pipelines, Tubing and Conduit

```
Installing Pipeline for High Quality
Production
Pipeline, tubing and conduits help
the sugarmaker get the freshest possible
sap to the sugarhouse. “Down hill,
straight and tight” is a slogan to keep in
mind when installing tubing. Pipeline
that sags, or is not pitched enough may
retain sap, which can develop
microorganisms as it ages, lowering

```
syrup quality. Use pipeline that’s wide
enough to move sap quickly, so you
maintain the sap’s high quality.
```
#### Choosing Tubing for High Quality Production.

```
Install tubing that’s specific for
maple syrup production. Tubing
companies have designed products that
move large volumes of sap long
distances in favorable conditions. Non-
commercial materials, such as black
plastic water pipe, which draws heat
from the sun, should be used with care
or not used at all. Sap flowing long
distances in dark pipeline exposed to
the sun may reach temperatures as high
as 80 degrees, even though air
temperatures are much lower.
Warm sap in lines, and later in
storage tanks, encourages microorganism
growth. To prevent this problem, dark
colored pipe may be painted white with
a non-toxic paint.
No matter what piping you use, be
certain that lines have no sags; sags trap
the sap, and permit bacteria growth.
```
```
If you use pipe that is not designed
specifically for sap collection, it must be
of high grade, the kind that is designed
for drinking water. Be certain that all
tubing is made of food-grade materials.
```
#### Clean Tubing and Quality

```
Clean tubing is vital to maximize
production of high-quality syrup.
Sanitize tubing right after the last sap
run. Some producers force a chlorine
bleach solution through the tubing (one
part unscented household chlorine
bleach to 20 parts water). They leave
this solution in the lines for a day or
two, after making certain that the lines
are completely filled.
Be sure all solution is thoroughly
rinsed from the lines. In addition to
```
```
flushing with water after the use of a
chlorine solution, many producers
allow the first sap to run onto the
ground. This gives tubing an extra rinse
at the beginning of the new season,
which is important for two reasons:
(1) even though most traces of chlorine
will evaporate during the sap boiling
process, the sodium or salt remains,
and becomes concentrated in the
syrup, ruining the flavor; and
(2) some sugarmakers and researchers
feel that rodents may be attracted by
the salt, so rinsing at both the
beginning and the end of the season
can help reduce rodent damage.
A hot water/air-mixture can be
forced through the sap lines as an
alternative to the chlorine bleach
sanitizing process. The turbulence of the
air mixed with water is an effective
cleaner, and leaves no chlorine residue
that could contaminate the sap.
Whatever procedure you choose, be
absolutely certain to rinse all chlorine
from lines and tanks. Don’t let any
chlorine solution to enter the lines that
may end up in the evaporator.
```
## Tree Tapping.

### Tap Only in White Wood.

```
Drill all tap holes into healthy, clean,
white wood. Generally a depth of not
more than 1½ inches is recommended.
When dark-colored wood shows in a
hole, that tap should not be used. A bad
tap hole will yield little or no sap, and
may spoil the flavor of large amounts of
syrup.
```
### Clean the Tap Holes.

```
Insert spouts right after drilling. Tap
them in gently to avoid any unnecessary
damage to the tree. When removing
wood chips, use a twig or other clean
```

```
tool to brush them out. Blowing into the
hole to remove chips is an unsanitary
practice. It will contaminate the tap hole.

**Warning: Don’t use para-
formaldehyde pellets.** In the past,
paraformaldehyde pellets were
recommended for use in tap holes; some
out-of-date sugaring manuals still
suggest their use. Research shows that
the use of paraformaldehyde pellets can
damage the trees, so they are now
illegal. Similarly, the use of denatured
alcohol as a disinfectant for tapholes is
also illegal in Maine.

### Sap Collection.

#### Timing is Important

Gather sap promptly, especially
when temperatures are above freezing.
Fresh, clean sap that has been kept cool
during collection and prior to boiling
will produce syrup that is one to two
grades higher than old, contaminated
sap. Since higher quality syrup
commands a higher price, it makes
sense to collect and boil sap as quickly
as possible.

#### Sap Gathering Pails

Gather sap from buckets in
containers that are specifically for that
purpose. Don’t use pails that have
contained non-food products.

#### Be Observant

Maple sap and syrup pick up off-
flavors easily. Be sure that particles
from exhaust pipes of tractors do not
float into gathering pails or tanks. If sap
has contact with any petroleum product
it is especially dangerous.

#### Sap Ice

Ice formed in sap buckets can help
keep sap cool in storage; however,
many sugarmakers throw it away

```
because they believe that it contains
very little sugar. With today’s high fuel
costs, you may wish to check the sugar
content of melted ice before deciding
whether or not to keep it.
```
### Sap Filtering.

```
You’ll need to filter sap through
multiple filters, first through a coarse
filter to remove bark, small wood
shavings and debris, then through a
finer filter. Removing foreign materials
from the sap before it is evaporated will
usually upgrade syrup by at least one
grade, a higher price for a small
investment. Change all sap filters often
and keep them clean to avoid off-
flavors. (Please see manufacturer’s
information regarding the care of filters.)
For filtering sap, many sugarmakers use
filtering materials that are available
from maple equipment suppliers.
```
### Sap Tanks.

#### Keep Tanks Clean Throughout the Season

```
Rinse and scrub gathering and
storage tanks with hot water between
runs, when practical. Be cautious if
you’re using a chlorine solution. Make
sure that everything the sap has come in
contact with has been thoroughly
rinsed, so that no chlorine residue
remains. The solution should not be
permitted to remain in the tanks, since
chlorine has corrosive effects on
galvanized metal.
```
```
Keep it Cool and Covered
Tanks should be located outside the
sugarhouse, preferably on the north or
northwest side, away from direct
sunlight. A loose covering over the
storage tanks will prevent rain and
foreign materials from lowering the
quality of the sap.

6MAPLESYRUPQUALITYCONTROLMANUAL

#### Storing Sap.

```
Sap should not be left long in tanks
when weather is above freezing; the
quality of the sap will begin to deteriorate,
producing lower-grade syrup.
```
## Quality Continues in the Sugarhouse: Processing Sap.

### Prompt Processing: One Key to High Quality.

```
For the highest quality syrup,
evaporate sap as quickly as possible.
Holding sap in buckets or tanks lowers
the quality of the syrup produced from
that sap. Always try to evaporate sap
completely before stopping. Generally,
a shallow sap depth and a hot fire make
for rapid syrup production, and high-
grade syrup.
```
#### Reverse Osmosis.

```
Reverse osmosis units are becoming
more common. They allow the
sugarmaker to remove large quantities
of water before the conventional
evaporation process. As with all
sugaring equipment, cleanliness is
critical. Follow the manufacturer’s
suggestions for cleaning. If you use an
anti-bacterial storage solution, or any
sanitizing solution, be sure to rinse
thoroughly with clean water before
processing sap to avoid off-flavor
and/or syrup contamination.
```
#### Defoamer.

```
Use as little defoamer as possible,
and be sure it’s fresh. Old defoamer
becomes rancid, and causes a rancid
flavor in syrup. Excess use of some
defoamers can also cause “fatty” off-
flavors.
```
```
If you use vegetable oil because of
special market requirements (religious
or dietary) take care to use the smallest
```
```
possible amount. In recent years, some
off-flavors due to vegetable oil have
occurred; the vegetable oil flavor tends
to especially affect the light amber
grade syrup.
```
```
Evaporator Pan
Keep pans clean. Change draw-off
sides often to prevent the accumulation
of niter (sugar sand), which can cause
scorching and off-flavored syrup. In
recent years producers have noted an
increase in off-flavored syrup due to
burnt niter. When evaporating with
reverse osmosis concentrate, niter build-
up is faster, requiring more frequent
change of draw-off sides. Should any
scorching occur, shut down and clean
up the burned area to prevent off-
flavors in the next batch of syrup.
```
### Maple Syrup Quality Control Puts the Accent on Flavor.

```
Maple syrup flavor must be
guarded from sap to store shelf. Flavor
can be damaged from contaminated,
unfiltered, or old sap, new and used
filters, caramelized sugar, fermentation
and mold, detergents, chemicals and rust.
```
## Syrup Density

```
Maine law requires maple syrup to
be evaporated to a density greater than
66 percent Brix at 68 degrees F.
Remember that syrup having a density
reading below 66 percent Brix is illegal.
Such syrup is more likely to ferment.
Syrup with a density above 68 percent
Brix may crystallize, causing consumer
complaint. Various instruments can be
used to check the density: hydrometers,
hydrotherms, refractometers and light
transmittance meters. For best results,
know how the instrument works and
how to protect its accuracy.
```

```
UMAINECOOPERATIVEEXTENSIONBULLETIN#7038 7
```
#### Low-Density Syrup.

The principal causes of low-density
syrup:

- Not making an adjustment of syrup
    temperature when checking density
    with a hydrometer.
- Using an inaccurate hydrometer.
- Inaccurate adjustment of heavy-
    density syrup.
- Steam condensing on surfaces, and
    running into the last containers of
    syrup to be packed. The last syrup in
    the tank should not be canned unless
    checked carefully for proper density.

#### Density Check at Draw-Off.

Use a deep container of small
diameter (hydrometer cups are
convenient) so that the hydrometer may
be floated immediately after each draw
off. Lower the hydrometer gently. Be
sure that the hydrometer does not touch
the bottom or sides of the hydrometer
cup. Make the reading at the point on
the hydrometer stem that is level with
the surface of the syrup (not the top of
the meniscus).

#### Syrup Refractometer.

Syrup refractometers are
instruments that may be used to test
maple syrup density. They are available
through maple equipment dealers. If
you use a refractomer, be sure to follow
instructions. Occasionally, problems can
occur that are due to incorrect calibration
of the instrument, leading to light or
heavy syrup. Also, producers and the
Department of Agriculture have found
that some instruments do not consistently
provide accurate readings when testing
hot syrup. You can check a refractometer
by comparing measurements to those
taken with an accurate, tested hydrometer
and a thermometer, or a refractometer.

#### Hydrotherm.

```
Hydrotherms are special
hydrometers with thermometers built in
to locate the point on the hydrometer to
measure standard density syrup. It is
used like a hydrometer but allowed to
sit for 30 to 40 seconds for the
thermometer column in the hydrotherm
to warm or cool to the syrup
temperature. The Department of
Agriculture does not recommend using
hydrotherms because they are not
calibrated to a standardized scale.
```
#### Light Transmittance Meter.

```
A light transmittance meter is a
newer tool that is used to check syrup
color. In a light transmittance meter, a
syrup sample is checked for color by
passing light through the sample. The
percent of light transmission is compared
to light transmission rates set for
different grades. When using one, you
need to be sure there are no fingerprints
on the syrup test bottle, and that the
syrup sample has no bubbles or
cloudiness. Any of these conditions may
diminish the light that is transmitted
through the sample and therefore
lowers the grade of the sample.
```
#### Automatic Draw-off.

```
Automatic draw-offs are not
completely accurate. Change the draw-
off side often, within hours, not days, or
when your scoop shows niter beginning
to build up in the pan. Using a
hydrometer or refractometer, test the
first syrup drawn off at the new side.
Adjust the draw-off frequently each
day, using a hydrometer or
refractometer, to establish the right
adjustment.
Important Note: Do not scoop near
the automatic draw-off until after it
shuts off. Scooping near the draw-off
will change the density reading of the
```
```
Hydrometer
```

8MAPLESYRUPQUALITYCONTROLMANUAL

```
drawn-off syrup. Clean the control
when changing sides. Nylon scouring
pads (unscented and soap-free) are
helpful. Never use steel wool. It will
scratch the pan and speed the build-up
of niter.
```
### Syrup Filtering.

#### Care of Filters.

```
Filters can impart off-flavors to
syrups, making the product unfit for
sale. Do not store filters in mothballs,
cedar closets, airtight containers, or near
scented materials. Clean filters
thoroughly, dry thoroughly, and store
in a cloth bag in
clean, dry, airy,
storage.Chlorine
bleach should not
be used to clean
filters.
Despite
repeated washings,
rinsings and
airings, filters that
have been
washed with
bleach still impart
off-flavors to
syrup. Scented
cleansers, fabric softeners, and “dryer
sheets” should not be used either. New
filters and pre-filters must be
thoroughly boiled in clean water (not in
sap pans) and air dried (in the sun if
possible). Use the “sniff” test to provide
an added check for your filters. Musty
old filters, or new chemical-smelling
filters should not be used.
```
```
The use of synthetic filters as pre-
filters (“cone” type or “flat type” filters)
save much labor. When they are used,
more effective filtration results, and the
heavy filters may be in service longer
between cleanings. Wash and dry pre-
filters often in pure, hot water.
```
```
Old, threadbare filters will cause
cloudy syrup. Hold filters up to bright
light to check for filter problems (cloudy
syrup must be graded substandard).
Remember to filter hot syrup (
degrees F) immediately after removal
from the pan. Do not stir syrup through
the filter.
```
#### Pressure Filters.

```
Clean all pressure filter parts
thoroughly with hot water prior to each
reassembly.
Filter plates have numbers or
patterns that indicate how the filter
press should be assembled. Line up
each numbered plate and smooth each
cloth so that there are no creases. Put a
thin rod through the plates during
assembly to help maintain the correct
position. Care taken with the assembly
of pressure filter units will help to
prevent niter in finished syrup, and loss
of finished syrup.
```
```
Experiment to find the exact amount
of filter aid (food grade Diatomaceous
Earth) needed to filter the syrup.
Filter papers should be changed
often enough and the pressure regulator
should be watched to avoid building up
of pressure and bursting of filter paper;
careful monitoring of the filter press
will help to avoid cloudy syrup.
```
## Quality Continues in the Sugarhouse: Syrup Packing.

```
Most sugarmakers will find it
advantageous to pack some syrup in
consumer-size containers during the
producing season. However, at least
part of the crop should be packed in
bulk containers for later reheating and
packing. Bulk containers offer these
advantages when used for long-term
storage:
```
- Packing syrup closer to the date of

```
Clean all pressure filter parts thoroughly with
hot water prior to each reassembly.
```

```
UMAINECOOPERATIVEEXTENSIONBULLETIN#7038 9
```
```
sale reduces the possibility of grade
change in the consumer size container.
This is especially important when
packing in plastic jugs.
```
- The potential of metallic flavors from
    cans is reduced.
- Reheating at packing time renews the
    fresh maple flavor.
- The possibility of rusty containers is
    lessened.
- The producer has greater versatility
    in meeting the current market
    demand for a specific container size
    and style, but also maintain the
    potential for bulk sale.
- The potential of waste due to leftover,
    unwanted sizes is eliminated.
- You can blend different “runs” to
    achieve greater uniformity of
    product.
- For small producers, five-gallon cans
    offer similar advantages to the 30-
    gallon barrel.

### Packing in Bulk.

Here are some tips for successful
bulk packing:

- Always examine bulk containers
    before filling.
- More bulk syrup is downgraded or
    ruined due to storage in drums that
    are in poor condition than by any
    other single storage cause.
- Use a flashlight to examine the
    interiors of drums.
- Use only bulk storage barrels or five-
    gallon cans that are rust-free, clean
    and dry. Steam cleaning is the best
    assurance of completely clean
    barrels.
- “Sniff” test the barrel and do not use
    if a foreign odor is present.
       - If you are buying new barrels,
          purchase stainless steel barrels.

### Filling Drums.

```
For the best results fill containers or
drums with hot syrup (above 180
degrees), and fill them full. Any air
space in the drum may cause problems.
Use new gaskets; tighten bungs as soon
as possible. Keep a sample from each
drum in your freezer and identify each
sample and its drum number. Then you
can repack the syrup without opening
additional drums. Remember to store
drums in a cool, dry place, and to
educate your bulk customers in the
proper storage and handling of bulk
syrup.
```
### Filling Retail Containers.

```
Here is a list of suggestions
that will help you ensure a
high-quality product ready for
retail sale.
```
- Open the cartons in which
    syrup cans are packed so that
    the empty cans are upside
    down. Keep the cans in that
    position until they are filled,
    so foreign material can’t get
    inside.
- Closely examine all
    containers. Return any that
    are damaged by excess flux or
    solder, dents or other
    imperfections. Do not fill cans
    that have any rust.
- “Sniff” test empty containers. This
    will sometimes help you cull out
    unusable containers.
- Fill containers full to assure correct
    volume for the consumer, and to
    minimize airspace, that contributes to
    product spoilage.

10 MAPLESYRUPQUALITYCONTROLMANUAL

#### Hot Packing

```
“Cold” pack has caused more
spoilage of syrup than almost any other
factor. Always pack syrup hot! When
packed at the right temperature, the hot
syrup will sterilize its container,
preventing spoilage. Then, when
properly sealed, a vacuum will be
created, preventing contamination.
The lowest safe temperature for
packing syrup is 180 degree F when the
cap goes on. Syrup that is left uncapped
for a few moments can cool sufficiently
and collect enough yeast and mold
spores from the air to spoil some cans in
an otherwise perfect lot.
Research by Dr. MariaFranca
Morselli of the University of Vermont
Maple Research Center indicates that
packing syrup at temperatures higher
than 180 degrees F (but not higher than
200 degrees F) will result in fewer
trouble-causing microorganisms.
```
```
However, if temperatures are raised too
high for too long, new niter may
precipitate, causing cloudiness.
(Refiltering reheated syrup can
eliminate cloudiness.) Continue to check
temperature with a sterile thermometer
immediately prior to filling the container.
For best results when heating syrup,
use a continual flow method rather than
heating a large volume of syrup in a
vat. Some syrups may deteriorate in
both color and flavor when heated in
large vats or pans, and held until canned
in retail containers. If the syrup is
continually flowing through several
compartments, while heating, it will
retain most of the original flavor and
quality. This also makes it easier to
maintain the correct packing temperature
(180 degrees and above).
Remember, the last container filled
from any batch may not be of correct
density. When a cover is used on filter
tanks, condensation may cause the last
syrup to be thin. If no cover is used, the
last syrup may be heavy.
```
```
When sealing plastic containers, be
sure inner seals are in container caps
when they are put on.
After capping the hot syrup,
immediately lay each container on its
side, neck down, to sterilize the air
pocket and cap. Check the closure for
leaks.
When containers are cool, spot
checking a few cans for density, color
and flavor is strongly recommended.
This will insure that the syrup meets the
standards for which it is labeled.
```
```
Avoid “Stack Burn”
“Stack burn” is grade change caused
by hot containers of newly canned syrup
stacked together, intensifying the heat,
and prolonging the cooling time. Stack

burn can change a low Grade A Medium
Amber syrup to Grade A Dark Amber.
This is a common cause of grade violations.

To prevent stack burn, make sure
you cool cans quickly. Space cans apart
so that air may circulate around them.
Do not place cans in cartons or on
pallets until cool. A fan may help to
speed the cooling process.

#### Code All Syrup.

Code each batch of syrup as it is
packed. If problems are found later,
positive identification will allow you to
recall only the syrup from the lot that is
defective.

## Grading Syrup for the Retail

## Container

#### Grading Kits

Grading is an important step in
your production process. First, be sure
that your grading kit is accurate, and
right for your operation. You can’t grade
a round bottle of syrup in a kit intended
for square bottles, or by using bottles of
different sizes. This can cause off-grade
syrup. Also, colored glycerin grading
guides fade with age. After one year,
most of these temporary guides are off-
grade. Check old kits, or replace them.

#### Color.

Proper grading can only be done
against a correct background. A clear,
blue sky is ideal; a fluorescent light is
better than a regular incandescent bulb.

Syrup should not be graded too
close to the minimum. Allow a little
extra premium color, especially when
packing in plastic or ceramic containers.
Stored syrup tends to darken in color,
particularly when packed in plastic and
ceramic jugs.

### Care and Storage of Canned Syrup.

```
The three main enemies of all stored
syrup are temperature, air, and time.
```
```
Temperature: Store syrup in a clean,
dry place of cool (if not refrigerated),
uniform temperature.
Some producers use a
household air
conditioner in the
storage room to retain
syrup quality,
protecting grade and
price.
Air: Even small
heads of air in
containers can cause
problems. Be sure to
completely fill all
containers.
Time: When packing or repacking
into retail-size containers, plan to fill
only the amount that you will sell within
the next few weeks. Retail containers
may lose their sales appeal, and the
syrup may lose flavor, color and grade
when stored for long periods. (Grade
loss is especially true of plastic containers,
in which syrup has been found to
darken as much as one grade in only
three months.)
```
### Reducing Lead in Syrup.

```
The lead content of most maple
syrup is extremely low, even when made
with lead containing equipment.
However, the only way to know the
lead content of your syrup is to have it
tested. Maine testing services are
available at the University of Maine. If
tests show your syrup has lead levels
within acceptable levels (below 250 ppb
```
```
Grading is an important step in your
production process. First, be sure that
your grading kit is accurate, and right for
your operation.
```

```
in Vermont), then your use of older
equipment is satisfactory, provided you
manage your equipment properly and
retest periodically.
Samples sent for lead testing should
be representative of most of your syrup.
Try to sample syrup from several syrup
batches and try to sample syrup made
at the beginning and end of a sap run.
Sample only syrup that has received the
final filtering. Collect samples in a clean
glass or plastic container and combine
into one lot. Send the required amount,
usually only a few ounces, to the lab of
your choice.
Lead does not come from trees. Sap
collected using lead-free plastic
materials has virtually no lead in it. Sap
collecting and syrup making materials
that contain lead include: 50/50 solder,
used before 1995 for evaporators, tanks
and some buckets (Leader Evaporator
switched to lead-free solder in 1991);
galvanized equipment made before
1994; most brass and bronze; and
terneplate, an alloy with a high lead
content used for some older equipment.
```
```
Sugar sand concentrates any lead in
the sap as it is formed so it should also
be treated as lead containing. Roadside
dust and dirt may also contain lead. In
tests of several models, all older metal
spouts added lead to maple sap. Very
old spouts may be made of terneplate
and will leach large amounts of lead
into the sap. Lead-free metal spouts are
now available. Not all buckets are equal
when it comes to lead. In tests,
Wheeling buckets added the least
amount of lead, while old “tin” buckets
added the most. Some old buckets have
shinier terneplate bottoms; beware of
these.
Lead containing buckets begin to
leach lead into sap within the first few
hours, and continue to add lead to sap
```
```
as long as it is in contact with metal
surfaces. Storage of sap in buckets for
several days, which may occur when sap
runs slowly, can result in very high sap
lead concentrations.
Galvanized and lead-soldered tanks
also add some lead to sap, although
usually less than buckets, because their
surface-to-volume ratio is smaller.
In an evaporator, a lead-soldered back
pan adds more lead than a lead-soldered
front pan, due to the many solder seams.
The lead content of partially made syrup
often decreases in the front pan, as lead is
precipitating and sticking to the pan in the
form of sugar sand.
```
```
After the evaporator is shut down,
lead will continue to accumulate in the
partially boiled syrup from lead solder.
Draining the front pan into buckets and
adding the syrup again once boiling
resumes, reduced lead accumulation.
Cleaning the front pan with water may
remove some of the sugar sand (source of
lead) but also re-expose lead solder
(source of lead). Water cleaning had little
effect on syrup lead concentration.
Frequently cleaning a lead-soldered pan
with acid will likely result in higher syrup
lead content.
Sugar sand may contain extremely
high amounts of lead, depending on the
concentrations of lead in the evaporator.
Good filtering is essential for keeping lead
out of syrup.
In tests, cone filters were as effective as
filter presses in removing lead. A large
percentage of lead in syrup is in a
dissolved form, however, which is not
filterable.
Bronze used in the manufacture of
gear pumps usually contains lead, and
these pumps can add lead to sap and
syrup. Unnecessary pumping, particularly
```

```
UMAINECOOPERATIVEEXTENSIONBULLETIN#7038 13
```
of sap, should be avoided. Other pump
models are available which contain little
or no lead.

Old milk cans frequently contain
terneplate, an alloy with a high lead
content, and should never be used for
syrup filtering or storage.

Syrup kept in older, heavy galvanized
barrels have a much higher lead content
after 8 months of storage. Newer
galvanized barrels do not add appreciable
lead in the same amount of time.

## Standards for Lead

## Concentration

Standards for lead concentration are
based on models of the maximum syrup
consumption by children. Standards
vary within the maple producing
regions of the U.S. and Canada. Syrup
producers and health officials share the
goal of a healthy and fine tasting
product that is safe from contaminants.
We are committed to the words “Pure
Maple Syrup” that we put on our cans.

If you are interested in testing your syrup
for lead, contact any of the following labs
listed in the box on page 10.

## After Sugaring Quality

## Begins for the Next Season

To ensure quality for next year,
clean all equipment as soon as possible
at the close of the maple season.

### Care of Evaporators.

Some producers allow sap to
ferment in English tin or stainless steel

```
pans. If this method is used, watch the
fermenting action carefully. When scale
loosens, scrub with a nylon pad. If
fermenting sap is left in pans too long,
serious damage may result. Rinse with
clear water, and dry. If chemical
cleansers are used, be sure to rinse
thoroughly to prevent possible damage
to the pan, and off-flavors next season.
Materials that collect on the
underside of the evaporator during the
season are generally corrosive to metal;
if corrosive deposits are permitted to
remain until the next season, holes may
result in the bottom of the front pan, or
in the flues. To avoid damage, clean the
underside of the front pan, and use a
brush to clean the flues. You can buy
special flue brushes from maple
equipment suppliers.
```
### Painting Equipment.

```
If sap tanks or other equipment
needs to be painted, use a non-toxic
epoxy paint. Paint meeting these
standards is available from a maple
equipment dealer. Painting at the close
of the season, as opposed to the
beginning of a new season, allows time
for odors to dissipate, reducing the
possibility of off-flavored syrup.
```
### Storing Equipment.

```
Store all equipment where it will
remain dry, lessening the potential of
rust.
```
### Cleaning Pipelines.

```
There are many different ways
sugarmakers have developed to clean
tubing. The following three are
probably the most common:
```
_1. Pulling Up and Cleaning:_ To do the
    best job, laterals should be rolled up
    and tied in bundles, taken to the

```
sugarhouse for cleaning and then
stored under cover. Before doing
this, number the system so it can be
rehung the next year. This is best
done by painting numbers or letters
on trees and putting a tag with a
corresponding number or letter on
the tubing. You don’t have to
number each tree, usually every fifth
or sixth one is adequate.
There are countless variations of
identification systems, but the
important thing is that the laterals go
up in the same place next year. Once
the laterals are numbered, roll them
up into bundles of about 25 taps.
Take each bundle to a tank filled
with cleaning solution and fill the
bundle with solution. This can be
done by pumping solution into the
bundle or mounting the bundle on a
rack that rotates the bundle through
the solution. Let the bundles sit in
the sun for one or two days and flush
them with clean water. As an added
precaution, some sugarmakers let the
first sap run through the lines onto
the ground. The same procedure
works well for cleaning main lines.
The rinse step is particularly
important in preventing off-flavors.
```
_2. Cleaning in Place:_ Many sugarmakers
    leave their tubing up in the woods
    year round and clean it in place.
    They usually do this by hooking up a
    vacuum pump to the lower end of
    the line, going to the top with a
    bucket of cleaning solution, pulling a
    spout, placing it in the bucket so
    solution is sucked through the
    tubing, then capping the spout and
    moving to the next. Some tubing
    manufacturers make fittings that are
    tight under positive pressure as well

14 MAPLESYRUPQUALITYCONTROLMANUAL

```
as vacuum. With this type of fitting,
the cleaning solution can be pumped
from the lower end of the line back
up the system.
```
_3. Commercial Systems:_ Maple equipment
    suppliers have commercial pipeline
    cleaning equipment which consists of
    a portable compressor pump that
    injects air with the cleaning solution,
    thus increasing the turbulence in the
    tubing, and improving the cleaning
    action. Some producers have
    purchased these in conjunction with
    one or more other sugarmakers to
    share the expense.

## Summary.

```
The most important contribution to
the production of high quality maple
syrup and syrup products, is cleanliness
and attention to detail in all parts of the
production process. Producers should
be careful to protect their efforts and
financial investment and produce the
highest quality syrup possible. A high
quality product adds to the image of
Maine-produced maple products as well
as to the producers’ profit level.
