Who should read this Manual?
```
```
This manual is intended for both trainers, and learners, to develop their
confidence, knowledge, and basic digital skills.
```
```
For trainers, this manual has different resources for use in supporting skills
development. For advanced learners, the manual can be used for independent
study, adding to the knowledge and skills gained through trainer-facilitated
sessions.
```
How to use this manual

If you are a trainer then you should read this manual, the supporting materials in the
accompanying annexes, and the accompanying SIDP **Pedagogy Guide: Guidance and suggestions
for trainers using Skills for Inclusive Digital Participation.** This guide includes guidance and
suggestions on how to achieve the most from this document. It also equips you with a step-by-
step guide on how to disseminate the various learning resources that are meant for the target
audience who include differently abled learners.

As a trainer or teacher, we assume you have a good understanding of how to use training
materials to develop knowledge, skills and confidence in your students. We also assume you will
use materials that are relevant for your students.

We have structured the course materials into self-contained topics to help give you flexibility
when you use these materials. You could deliver all the training materials to all of your students,
or you could choose to deliver only the topics that are useful for your students to learn more
about. It is our hope that this flexibility in the use of training materials will help you deliver
appropriate learning journeys for your students.

Recommended and discretionary topics

The content in these manuals is divided into topics. The topics are manuals are categorised into
three types

```
Recommended topics
These are topics that important for many learners, but possibly not for all
learners. A good understanding of these topics is an important foundation for
developing digital skills. Recommended topics should be covered if possible.
```
```
Recommended topics can be very useful as:
```
**1**


1. Extension exercises in a training workshop.
2. As an assignment after a training workshop.
3. As preparatory work before a training workshop, for instance when a learner
    moves from basic manual to another manual.

```
Discretionary topics
These topics should be covered if there is time, or an interest in the subject. These
topics cover important areas of knowledge and skills, but they may be slightly
more advanced in nature, or more specific in application.

## 2. First steps


```
First steps
```
```
This topic introduces you to the basics of using a computer and other digital
devices. These devices include computers laptops, tablets, smartphones and other
gadgets that learners may or may not have been exposed to.
```
What is digital?

The term "digital" is currently used to represent everything that a computer uses and produces.

The word "digital" describes a numbering process or a series of number processing. This
processing is done by a computer device. Therefore, "digital" is closely associated with activities
that use and are generated by computers.

Learning outcomes

By the end of this topic, you will be able to:

1. Identify different digital devices.
2. Understand what the internet and the world wide web are.
3. Identify different types of operating systems.

Introducing you to digital technology

Here are some words and phrases you should know:

1. Digital devices are electronic tools come in many forms. Common devices include
    computers, laptops, tablets, and smartphones (such as the iPhone or Android phone). A
    digital device allows you to enter data that is processed, and this results in a useful
    output. The information can then be stored in the device for future use.
2. Data is information. Data is entered into a digital device using an input device, for
    instance via a keyboard, mouse, touchpad, scanners, light pen, or joystick.
3. Processing of data to information takes place in the brain of the device which is the
    Central Processing Unit (CPU).
4. Information or output is data that has been processed. Output can be produced either in
    hard copy (such as paper or printed photos) or soft copy (such as electronic files).
    Examples of output devices include monitor/screen, printer, and speakers.
5. The processed data (information), programs (instructions that tell the computer what to
    do) and raw data can also be stored for future use on storage devices like SD cards, flash
    disks, hard disks or optical disks.


Advantages of using digital devices

Digital devices allow the user access to digital technology which has many advantages over more
established tools and processes such as pen and paper, the postal service or face-to-face banking.

These advantages include:

6. Easier, faster, and better communication e.g., emails, social media and social messaging.
7. Fast access to information (local & global) when the digital device is connected to the
    internet.
8. The ability to create a wide variety of content relatively easily.
9. The ability to sell and buy online.
10. Accessing learning and knowledge and gaining new skills.
11. The ability to store a vast amount of data and information.
12. Increased accessibility and usability as digital devices can be controlled with text, sound
    and video.

There are also disadvantages and risks associated with digital technology. These include:

13. Digital technology can be expensive to buy, run, insure and replace.
14. Expensive technology can be seen as valuable and worth stealing.
15. Digital devices require access to electricity, either as the main power source or to charge
    batteries that allows the device to be portable.
16. Access to the internet can be both expensive and difficult to secure.
17. Excessive use of technology can have negative effect on your physical and mental health
    and social relationships.

Types of digital devices

There are many different types of digital devices that you can use. Devices can be expensive but if
you are prepared to use less powerful devices, they can be much less expensive. The size of
devices can vary, and you need to consider storage and portability when buying one.

The physical form of the device and its contents, such as screen and electronic components, are
called hardware. This is because you can physically feel this part of a digital device.

Here is a summary of some typical digital devices.


```
Personal Computer (PC)
A personal computer is a type of computer that is usually placed on a desk and specifically
designed to be used by one person at a time. It is made up of different parts that are connected
to work as a single entity. The figure below illustrates a desktop computer.
```
## Figure 1: A typical desktop personal computer system

```
The system unit (sometimes called a base unit)
This part of the computer contains the brain of the computer and other parts such as the CD/DVD
Drive. You can connect extra devices to the system unit with special cables.
```
```
There are two main types of system units:
```
1. Tower system units are usually placed upright on a table and the monitor is placed next to it.

## Figure 2: A typical desktop tower unit PC system

2. Desktop system units are usually placed flat on a table. The monitor is usually placed on top
    of it.


## Figure 3: A typical desktop system unit

**Peripheral devices (mouse, keyboard, screen)**

Peripheral devices are parts of the computer systems that help a computer get information in and
out. Peripherals help you control and communicate with a computer.

Peripherals are connected to the system unit through special holes called “ports”.

1. PS/2 port - Used to connect the mouse and the keyboard
2. VGA Port - Used to connect the monitor or the projector
3. USB Port - Used to connect the mouse, keyboard, printers, scanners
4. AUDIO Port - Used to connect the speakers or headphones

## Figure 4: Input and output ports for a desktop PC


**Advantages of a desktop computer over a laptop**

5. A desktop computer is relatively cheaper compared to a laptop.
6. It has many ports so you can connect more peripheral devices compared to a laptop.
7. You can connect to a large screen/ monitor.

Laptop

A laptop is a smaller and lighter type of personal computer that is designed to be placed on the
lap when working. As these come with batteries you do not need to be connected to an electricity
source, except when you need to charge the batteries, this allows you to travel with the laptop.
However, they are more expensive than desktop computers.

## Figure 5: A typical laptop computer

**Advantages of a laptop over Personal Computer**

8. A laptop is portable so you can move with it from one place to another.
9. Some peripheral devices are inbuilt such as keypad, touchpad and speakers.
10. You can work with a laptop, even when there is no power, since it has a battery which is
    chargeable.

Tablet

A tablet is a mobile device that is smaller and lighter than a laptop. It is operated by touching the
screen. It has a chargeable battery. Unlike a laptop its keyboard is the screen.


## Figure 6: A typical computer tablet

Smartphone

A smartphone is part computer and part mobile telephone. It is a small digital device that is held
in your hand. It is mostly used for communication through making phone calls or sending a short
text message. However, it also has other capabilities such as taking photos and videos. You can
also use a smartphone to connect to the internet.

A smartphone is navigated through touching the screen (commonly referred to as touch screen).
In this way it is very similar to using a tablet device.

## Figure 7: A typical smartphone

A computer is made up of both hardware and software

A digital device is not one thing, it is made up of many parts. Some of these are physical like the
“hardware” and some you cannot see like the “software”.


Software is the computer instructions that direct a computer on what to do and how to do it.
Operating systems, sometimes called OS, are very important because it manages the computer's
memory, power, hardware, and other software. Operating systems such as Microsoft Windows,
or MacOS, are well known, and they do the basic tasks and housekeeping of a computer.

For a computer to be useful we need other programs. These applications, sometimes shortened
to “apps”, are types of software that do specific things such as help us write a letter, watch a
video, or undertake calculations and manipulate data.

Examples of application software includes Microsoft Word, Microsoft Excel, Word Pad and Calc.

Computer operating systems

An operating system is a program that controls all the functions, including both hardware and
software, in an electronic device. For any communication and storage of data to take place in a
device, there must be an operating system.

The phrase operating system is sometimes shortened to OS.

Functions of operating system

The operating system in a digital device has many jobs. The operating system makes the tasks you
do easier because it uses pictures and symbols to help you navigate and use a digital device. This


approach to controlling and using a computer is called a graphical user interface (GUI) or user
interface (UI).

Some jobs an OS does include:

1. Managing other software. This can include application software (or apps) that do specific
    things.
2. Control hardware devices such as printers.
3. Resource allocation such as accessing and using networks.
4. Enable communication between hardware and software.
5. Allow users to interact with the software, e.g., gaming, typing.

## Figure 9: The functions of an operating system in a digital device

Strengths and limitations of different of computer operating systems

Apple iOS

Apple’s iOS is a popular operating system for smartphones. It works on Apple hardware, including
iPhones and iPad tablets. iOS has a simple control system and has strong safety features, known
as encryption, that prevents unauthorised access to your data. The system allows you to access to
an application shop where users can buy and download free or paid for apps.

Microsoft Windows

Microsoft Windows is the most common home and office software operating system. It is also
used by many companies and governments. Microsoft Windows user interface include windows
which are panel-screens that represent individual applications in a rectangular shape.


Apple macOS

Apple laptops use the macOS. Although the graphical interfaces are different, many of the
programming interfaces and command-line features are similar. macOS has The Dock which is a
bar of controls that is used to check for programs and files that are commonly used, single
keyboard keys, including the Command key. macOS is famous for its user-friendly functionalities
like Siri, a natural-voice personal assistant, and FaceTime a video chatting software.

Linux Operating System

Linux is a secure and customisable operating system. Linux is open-source software. This means
that it generally very safe against virus attack and errors, and it is also free to use, although you
may have to pay for support. Many electronic gadgets such as internet routers, washing
machines, TVs, refrigerators use special Linux software.

Factors to consider when selecting an operating system for your device

1. The cost: open-source software (such as Linux) is usually free for personal use, but
    licensed software (such as Microsoft Windows) needs to be paid for.
2. User-friendliness of the operating system.
3. Availability and range of applications software that works with the chosen OS.
4. Its security features, particularly against viruses e.g., Linux is more secure than the
    Windows OS. Antivirus software is available for operating systems or may have this built
    into the OS, e.g., Windows Defender.

Application Software

These are types of software that help you do useful tasks. Applications are installed on a
computer and are managed by the operating system e.g., MS Word for document creation, or
Windows Media Player for playing videos.

Types of application software include:

1. Word processor – for creating documents e.g., MS-Word.
2. Database – for keeping records and files e.g., MS Access.
3. Spreadsheet – for calculations e.g., MS Excel.
4. Desktop publishing – designing publications such as cards or posters e.g., Adobe Page
    Maker.
5. Computer-Aided Design – for technical drawing e.g., AutoCAD.


6. Graphics software – for designing and manipulating graphics e.g., Photoshop.

Hardware

Hardware is any part of a computer that can be touched or felt. Hardware devices are categorized
into:

1. Input devices.
2. Output devices.
3. Storage devices.
4. Processor (CPU).

Input devices

These are peripherals or devices that help get information into a computer. Input devices come in
many forms.

```
Keyboard/Keypad
A keyboard or keypad is used to enter data into a computer or
laptop. One enters data using the keyboard’s letter, numerical
or special character keys.
```
```
Mouse/ touchpad
```
```
These are pointing devices. They control a pointer on the
screen usually to select commands.
```
```
Light pen
This is a handheld pen-like device that has a light sensitive
point and is used to select options on a touch screen.
```

```
Scanning device
```
```
This is a device that reads data which may be in a form of a
photo, printed work or handwritten (hard copies) and converts
it to a soft copy (digital copy) that one can manipulate using
special software.
```
```

This topic has options for you to follow for both computers (such as desktops or laptops) and
mobile devices (such as smartphones or tablets).

This topic begins with a brief explanation of basic digital navigation skills that will be useful for
you to learn.

## 8.3 Basic navigation skills

## 8.3.1 How to use a mouse

A mouse is a pointing device that helps you use a computer system without using a keyboard.


## Figure 21: A typical mouse and its buttons

The mouse is a computer input device used to move a “cursor” around a screen. A cursor is a
symbol that tells you and the computer where the mouse is currently positioned. You can use the
cursor to turn on and off apps and programmes, locate and move files and folders.

Here are some ways that a mouse is used:

1. **Left Clicking**. This is pressing the left button of the mouse once. Left clicking selects an
    object or item.
2. **Double Clicking.** This is clicking the left button of a mouse in quick succession. Double
    clicking opens a program.
3. **Drag and Drop**. This means clicking on the button on the left-hand side of the mouse and
    keeping the button pressed down. Select an icon (remember do not release the button)
    then drag the icon to move it to another location on the desktop. Drag and drop is also
    used when selecting or highlighting text.
4. **Right Clicking.** Clicking the button on the right-hand side of the mouse displays a list of
    options.


## 8.3.2 How to use a laptop touchpad

Most laptops have a built-in peripheral called a Touchpad to move a cursor around the screen.
You can use a Touchpad in place of a mouse to control a cursor.

## Figure 22: Location and function of a TouchPad

Here is a brief tutorial on how to use a touchpad.

1. Slide one finger along the centre of the **touchpad** to move the cursor
2. **Tap gently** to select, or press the left button beneath the touchpad
3. Press the **button on the right** to Right-click on an object
4. Place your finger along the right edge of the touchpad and slide your finger up or down to
    scroll.

## 8.3.3 Touch screen navigation

There are three main ways of navigating a touch screen of a phone or a laptop.

Tapping

This works the same way a mouse click works on a laptop or desktop with a mouse. Tapping is
used to open a program, typing, and selecting buttons when browsing the internet.

**To Tap** : Lightly place the tip of your index finger onto the screen and raise it again, quickly. The
touch only needs to be for a fraction of a second for the screen to respond, and you don't need to
press down hard.

Swiping


The process of moving from one screen to another is called Swiping.

**To Swipe:** Slowly place one finger on the screen and pull to the right or left, up or down of the
screen, then release your finger.

Scrolling

If the document you are viewing on your screen is long and does not fit on the screen at once, you
need to touch the screen to move up or down, left or right to reveal more. This is scrolling.

**To scroll** : Place the fingertip gently on the screen and slowly drag it up or down, left or right. Keep
contact with the screen as you do this. When you get to the place on the page you want to view,
lift your finger from the screen.

## 8.3.4 Typing on a touch screen device

A touch screen device such as a smartphone or a tablet has an onscreen keyboard. It will look like
the figure (Figure 24) below and is a copy of a real keyboard.

You can type on the virtual keyboard by tapping the keys you need.

## Figure 23: An onscreen keyboard

See section **8.5 Navigating your device** in this manual for more detail on using virtual keyboards.

## 8.3.5 How to use a keyboard

A keyboard is a part of a computer that is mostly used to enter data by typing. A keyboard has
different types of keys that do different things.


The five categories include:

Alphanumeric keys

Alphanumeric keys are the familiar keys that you may have used when typing numbers, letters
and special characters like question marks, semicolons, and full stop. These keys include:

1. “A to Z”, “a to z”, “0 to 9” and other symbols.
2. Caps Lock Key. When it is on, the characters typed appear in capital letters (also called
    upper case). When Caps Lock is off letters appear as small letters (or lower case).
3. Enter Key/Return Key: Moves the cursor to the beginning of a new sentence.
4. Tab Key: Moves the cursor along at set intervals on the same line.
5. Space Bar: This is the longest key on the keyboard. This inserts a space between words
6. Backspace Key: Deletes or erases characters from right to left.

## Figure 24: A typical computer keyboard


Cursor Movement and Editing keys

They are used to move the cursor from one point of the screen to another. They include:

1. Arrow Keys: These move the cursor in the direction the arrow faces
    1. Up arrow key - Moves the cursor one line up
    2. Down arrow key - Moves the cursor one line down
    3. Right arrow key - Moves the cursor to the right
    4. Left arrow key - Moves the cursor to the left
5. Insert Key: Used to replace a character at the cursor position
6. Delete Key: Deletes or removes characters from left to right
7. Home Key: Takes the cursor to the beginning of the current sentence
8. End Key: Takes the cursor to end of the current sentence
9. Page Up: Takes the cursor one page up, when there are many pages.
10. Page Down: Takes the cursor one page down, when there are many pages

## Figure 25: Editing keys and cursor keys on a keyboard


Numeric Keypad Keys

It consists of numbers 0 - 9, the addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*) and Division sign (/).
For you to be able type numbers using the numeric keypad, always make sure the Number Lock
Key is on.

## Figure 26: Numeric keypad

Function Keys

These are keys that are located at the top of the keyboard. They are labelled as F1, F2, F3 through
to F12. F1 is mostly used to open the Help window.

Generally, their purpose differs from one program or software to another.

## Figure 27: Function keys on a keyboard


Special Purpose Keys

The Shift Key

This special key works in combination with other keys. It does not do anything if you use it on its
own.

1. It can be used to get single capital letters. Hold down the **SHIFT key** + **an alphabet key** to
    get the letter in its capital (or upper case) form.
2. It is used to get the punctuation marks on top of the number keys or the symbols on top
    of certain keys, especially on the alphanumeric section.
3. To get the punctuation mark on top of a number key or the symbol on top of a certain
    key. Press & hold down the SHIFT key before pressing the required key.

## Figure 28: The Shift Key

The Control Key

The Control Key, sometimes shortened to CTRL, allows you to use various functions in
combination with other keys. These functions are dependent on your operating system, but some
typical combinations include:

1. **CTRL** + “ **S** ” is used to give the command for Save the text/object
2. **CTRL** + “ **X** ” is used to give the command to Cut the text/object
3. **CTRL** + “ **C** ” is used to give the command to Copy the text/object
4. **CTRL** + “ **V** ” is used to give the command to Paste the text/object


## Figure 29: The Control Key

The Escape Key

The Escape Key, sometimes shortened to ESC, generates a special code for a computer. In many
programs, it is used when you want to end a task. The Key allows you to “escape”, stop or cancel
a task you were doing.

## Figure 30: The Escape Key

Navigating a computer or laptop

Below are descriptions on how to navigate the screens of the various electronic devices.

Using “Icons”

The first screen seen after turning on a laptop or a computer is known as a Desktop. It consists of
small graphics known as Icons. The icons represent software applications, locations, or tasks.
Icons simplify using a computer.


## Figure 31: A computer desktop with Icons

The Icons in the diagram below are:

1. This PC, an Icon that gives you access to the files in this computer.
2. Meetings, an Icon that gives you access to files in a folder called Meetings.
3. To Read Icon, an Icon that gives you access to a Word file called “To Read”.

## Figure 32: Some Icons and their meanings

Navigating your mobile device

Smartphones are small and powerful digital devices that are used to make phone calls and send
text messages, but they can also be used to access the internet, send and receive emails and
many of the tasks you can do on a laptop.

There are many different brands for smartphone including:

1. iPhones from Apple.
2. Android Phones from Samsung, HTC, Huawei etc.
3. Windows Phones from Nokia.

These phones have different operating systems (See section 2.8 in this manual).

You can use your fingers to control the phone, or you can use a stylus. This is a device that looks
like a pen or pencil but has no ink. It is used like a pen on the phone/tablet screen. You use it to
press on apps and functions and to navigate a smartphone or tablet. If you have the app, you can
also use the stylus to write into the mobile device, rather than typing.


## Figure 38: A stylus can be used to help you navigate mobile devices such as

```

```
Using computers and smartphones safely
```
```
In this topic you will learn:
```
1. How to keep your device clean and dry and the importance
of doing this.
2. How to take care of your device battery.
3. How to keep your device safe from theft and fire.

The importance of keeping equipment clean

Keeping a digital device clean is important for the health of the device and also for your health.
Here are some reasons why it’s a good idea to keep your equipment clean and in good working
order.

Laptop and desktop computers

A clean computer:

1. Reduces the risk of infection.
2. Dust can damage delicate parts of your computer.
3. Dust can clog up the cooling fan which in turn can cause your device to overheat.
4. Dirt in your keyboard can make the keys less responsive or cause them to stick.
5. A clean screen is easier to see and reduces eye strain.

Smartphones

Clean phones are good because:

6. It prevents clogging of the earpiece and mouthpiece.
7. It enhances quality hygiene on the case when you are sharing a phone.
8. It prevents dust from accumulating in the earphone hub and charging system.

Step by step instructions to keeping your digital device clean

Below are some ways for looking after a laptop, phone, and a desktop computer.

Laptop and Desktop Computer

1. Disconnect from power when fully charged.
2. When on the move, safely pack the laptop into a laptop bag.


3. Keep data backup in external media. This means an external hard disk that you leave in a
    safe place or use online backup options like OneDrive and Google Drive. This will prevent
    the chances of data loss in case the laptop stops working, is damaged or is stolen.
4. Install an up-to-date antivirus program to protect your laptop from viruses.
5. Set up a user account and password to prevent unauthorised access to your laptop.
6. Keep your laptop computer well ventilated to avoid overheating. Avoid stacking papers,
    books and other items around your computer. Allow the fan to breathe.
7. Organize your files into folders and sub folders for ease of access.
8. Dust has the potential to damage your computer and its parts. Use a soft, clean cloth to
    regularly wipe all parts of your computer.
9. Write down somewhere safe the serial number of your device in case of theft for easy
    identification purposes for the police or insurance purposes.

Phone

1. Use a screen protector.
2. Buy a phone case to keep it safe from accidental knocks.
3. Keep the phone away from moisture and dampness.
4. Regularly wipe your phone clean.
5. Regularly clear the computer memory of unused files and folders. Clear your phone
    cache. When apps run, they may leave some files behind taking up memory space in your
    phone.
6. Regularly update the operating system in your smartphone.
7. Once the phone battery is fully charged, disconnect it from power. This prevents damage
    to the phone battery.
8. To save on the phone battery and increase performance, close all the apps after use.
    Avoid having many apps opened at the same time.
9. Turn off all services you are not using. For example, Wi-Fi, live wall papers and mobile
    data. This slows down battery usage.
10. Don't leave your phone in the hot sun for a long period of time because it will overheat.
11. Add an external SD card to increase the available memory space. This frees up the
    phone's internal memory, hence improving the phone’s performance.
12. Identify a safe place to keep your phone when not in use.
13. Special software can be used to lock your phone in cases of theft.
14. Connect only to trusted Wi-Fi’s.


Charging batteries, and managing risk of fire

Portable computers work using rechargeable batteries. Do not let your device run out completely
of power, and do not overcharge it. This will increase the life of the battery.

Overcharging a battery may cause it to overheat and start a fire.

The best time to start charging is at 15% of the battery. The optimal charge level is 40% -80%. Do
your best to maintain the charge at that level.

Activity: Familiarise yourself with safety features of your device

You will:

1. Find out the IMEI number of your phone or the serial number of your laptop.
2. Find out if you have put into place the safety measures to safeguard your laptop or
    phone.

After you have completed the activity reflect and record your work. Record your thoughts on:

3. How to use your devices safely.
4. How to take care of your device.

## 11. Creating account and

## creating passwords


```
Creating accounts and creating passwords
```
```
A user account is an online place that stores the user’s information identified by a
username and protected by a password, e.g., WhatsApp account, a Facebook
account, a Twitter account, or an ecitizen account.
```
A password is a string of characters used to verify the identity of a user during an authentication
process. Passwords are typically used together with a username, or user identification (sometimes
called User ID). They are designed to be known only to the user thus allowing the user, and no
one else, to gain access to a document, device, application, website, or a social media platform.

A username/user ID is a sequence of characters that uniquely identifies a user on a computer
system, a computer application, a website, or a social media platform. Other words used to mean
the same term are login name, logon name, sign in name or sign on name.

Expected Outcome from Creating Accounts and Password

When you have completed this topic, you will have:

1. Improved security when using a computer/mobile device, application, or social media
    site.

Creating Accounts and Password

Purpose of a Password

While accessing the internet, a user needs a user ID and password to prevent unauthorised
people from accessing the information stored on their device. Such information may include
details of bank accounts, college account, emails, social media accounts, e-citizen account and any
other account created online.

It is therefore important to learn how to create secure passwords and how to manage them to
protect your information.

Bad password practices

Passwords are essential to the security of your personal information. It is important that you
avoid bad password practices such as:

2. Using simple formulaic passwords.
3. Sharing passwords.
4. Writing down passwords in physical locations that are easy to find.


5. Reusing the same password for some or all your accounts.

It is important to create a good password, but also to keep the password safe. Additional software
called a Password Manager can help you with this.

Activity: Create an online account

For this activity you will:

6. Open a Google account.
7. Open a Yahoo account.

After you have completed the activity reflect and record your work.

## 12. Introduction to internet and the World Wide Web


```
Introduction to internet and the World Wide Web
```
```
The internet is a global network which allows for communication and resource
sharing across the world.
```
```
World Wide Web, also known as the web, is a system which contains resources
that are accessed through the internet. The world wide web uses website sites to
create virtual spaces on the internet where videos, files, images, and other digital
resources are stored so that you can view, store and retrieve them.
```
```
Wi-Fi is a wireless technology that enables electronic devices with wireless
adapters such as laptops, mobile phones, TVs, and tablets to connect to the
internet.
```
Expected learning outcomes from this topic

At the end of this topic, you will understand these words and be able to answer following
questions:

1. What is the internet, what is Wi-Fi?
2. Why are these important?
    1. How to connect to the internet.
    2. Mobile hotspots.
    3. Wi-Fi.
    4. Hardwire connections.
    5. Using a web browser.

Importance of connecting to the Internet

Access to the internet is a powerful enabler. With internet connections to the rest of the world
you can communicate with friends and family, look for a job, learn new skills, or get your business
online and help it succeed.

The internet allows you access to information on almost any subject matter, as well as an
improved ability to communicate and collaborate with other people all over the world. These
people may be customers, students or teachers, friends and family, or even representatives of a
company or government department.

Using cables to connect to the internet


The oldest, and still a very common way to connect to the internet, is with physical wires. This is
sometimes called a hardwire connection.

It is normally the simplest way to connect as a cable is plugged into your device and another
device that provides internet to your house, school or office, known as a router, or hub.

The cables and connections look like this:

## Figure 46: Cables and connections

These devices need to have an ethernet port where the cable is connected to and a source of
internet (wall sockets in cyber cafes, offices, homes etc.)

There are many ways to connect to the internet such as via Mobile hot spots, wi-fi and mobile dial
up.


Connecting to the internet through Wi-Fi

Wi‐Fi or wireless internet allows you to access the internet without using up any of the mobile
data in your calling plan.

If you have broadband access at home, school or at work then you can also connect your
smartphone to this internet signal.

To connect your smartphone to Wi-Fi:

1. **Tap** on the **Settings** Icon.
2. **Tap** on the **Wireless and Networks** option.
3. **Tap** on the **Wi-Fi icon.**

## Figure 47: The Wi-Fi symbol

4. Select the Wi‐Fi network you want and enter the **password.**
    1. If the word **connected** appears under the network name then you are connected
       to the Wi‐Fi.
    2. Wi-Fi in public spaces such as libraries, cafes and hotels may need a password.
       Some may not. Most are free to use, or free for customers to use.

Activity: Connecting to the Internet

Try the following activities.

1. Connect to a Wi-Fi hotspot (a publicly accessible place where you can connect to the
    internet)
    1. Turn on the Wi-Fi on your laptop/phone/tablet.


2. Scan/refresh for any available wireless networks (the list of available wireless
    networks is displayed automatically when you turn on the Wi-Fi).
3. Click on the wireless network you want to connect to.
4. Enter the correct password and click on connect. if the Wi-Fi password is correct,
    your device should be connected within a minute.

After you have completed the activity reflect and record your work.

## 13. Using a web browser


```
Using a web browser
```
```
A web browser is a type of application software that allows you to access
resources and websites on the world wide web.
```
```
There are many examples of web browsers. The most common ones in use are
Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Apple Safari and Microsoft Edge.
```
## Figure 48: Some popular web browsers

```
All these browsers work in very similar ways and have similar controls. If you can
use one type of web browser then you will be able to apply those skills to other
browsers.
```
Web addresses, or Uniform Resource Locators (URLs)

Users find, or locate, web pages online using a web address celled a Uniform Resource Locator
(URL).

A couple of widely known URLs are:

1. https://facebook.com/ for Facebook and
2. https://www.youtube.com/ for YouTube.

To access either of the above URLs do the following:

1. Ensure you are connected to the internet (either cable, mobile data, or Wi-Fi).
2. Open a web browser such as Google Chrome web browser from your phone/computer.
3. Type the URL on the address bar on the web browser as shown below.

Understanding a URL – the address of a website

There are three basic parts of a URL you should understand. These the protocol, the domain name
and the path.


## Figure 49: The different parts of a web address

The protocol tells the browser how to communicate with a website’s server, to send and retrieve
information. It is what enables a URL to work in the first place.

https or Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS) is the most important part of the URL.

The Domain name is the identifier for a specific website which brings one straight to the home
page. It is a domain name that is made up of two smaller parts - the **name of the website** in
question and the **top-level domain**.

Let’s take [http://www.google.com](http://www.google.com) as an example:

4. The name of the website is google.
5. The top-level domain is .com.

The path is an extra part of the address that points to a specific resource or page on a website.


If we take https://mail.google.com/gmail as an example, the:

6. The protocol is https, a secure protocol.
7. The domain is google.
8. The path is /Gmail.

## Figure 50: An address bar in a typical web browser

Navigation buttons in Google Chrome

Google Chrome web browser has the following important navigation buttons:

1. Back Button - This button navigates backwards through recently opened pages.
2. Forward Button - This button navigates forwards through recently accessed pages.
3. Refresh Button - This button reloads a page. Useful e.g., when the page doesn't load
    correctly, it helps to reload a page correctly.


## Figure 51: Google Chrome, a typical web browser and basic navigation buttons

Bookmarks and history

You can save your favourite pages in a web browser so that you can view/go back to them later.
This is similar to inserting a bookmark in a book so that you can easily pick up from where you
stopped reading. This is called bookmarking.

To create a bookmark, start by clicking on the star at the extreme right-hand side of the address
bar.

## Figure 52: The bookmark icon on the address bar of a typical web browser

1. Select the Add Bookmark option from the dropdown list.
2. Give your bookmark a name.
3. From the folder option select Bookmarks Bar as shown below.
4. Click on done.
5. Your bookmark is now added and is available just below the address bar. You open the
    bookmark by clicking on it.


## Figure 53: Editing the name on a bookmark

While using a web browser, every page you visit is stored by the browser in history. This allows
you to return to a recently viewed page, in a similar way as bookmarks.

To look at your history on your browser:

1. If the back and forward buttons are active, click and hold your mouse on any of them and
    select See full history, or
2. Click on the three dots on the top right of the browser and select history.

## Figure 54: Accessing your browsing history


## 14 Downloading/saving files


```
Downloading/saving files
```
```
Downloading a file means saving a copy of a resource found online to your mobile
phone or computer. These could be documents, pictures, videos, apps or
programs. Web browsers are able to handle most downloading activities. If you
have a difficult or large resource to download you may need additional software
called a Download Manager.
```
To download an image

1. Right click the image and select **Save Image As**.
2. Click **OK.**

## Figure 55: Right clicking an image to download the image

Steps to downloading a document

1. **Open** to view the document.
2. If it’s a PDF file, in the top right corner of the window, find the **down arrow** and **click** on it.
3. The document will download to your computer.
4. Note: On mobile phones, once you click a link with a pdf document, the files are
    downloaded to your device automatically.


## 15. Safe browsing on the Internet


```
Safe browsing on the Internet
```
```
Getting online safely can give you access to information, social connections and
economic opportunity. If you practice unsafe online practices or have unsecured
digital devices you may open yourself up to danger on the internet. While
innocently surfing the Web, you may not realize that you could be picking up
spyware, downloading malware, or even visiting fraudulent sites. You do not have
to be afraid of every click made on the internet, but there are some simple
precautions you should take to stay safe while you’re browsing.
```
Keep your browser updated

New forms of online content that can access and damage your computer are constantly being
introduced. You can help to keep your computer safe by updating your browser. This is done by:

1. Using the latest version of your browser.
2. Installing all recent updates.

Domain and URL checking

Malicious sites often use deceptive domains to trick users into believing they are on a legitimate
site. A malicious website is any website that’s been designed to cause harm. The following are
some traits common to many malicious websites.

1. The website asks you to download software, save a file, or run a program
2. The website tells you that your device is infected with malware or that your browser
    extensions or software are out-of-date.
3. The website claims you have won a prize and requests your personal information to claim
    it.
4. Visiting the website automatically launches a download window.
5. You are asked to download an invoice or receipt, such as a PDF file, .zip or .rar, or an
    executable file or .scr screensaver file

Be cautious of free software

Common types of free software include desktop backgrounds, free images, emoticons, computer
games, etc. The consequences of installing unverified and untrustworthy programs can range
from a minor annoyance to a loss of funds.. Such software can be a drain on your computer
system and resources. Take proper precautions when searching for new software and avoid the
free offers.

Be cautious of peer-to-peer file sharing

Peer-to-peer file sharing is a little different from the normal way of downloading a file from and
internet source. In peer-to-peer sharing, a special program is used instead of your web browser.


This special program looks for computers on the internet that have the file you want. These
computers are ordinary computers like yours. They are called peers.

Peer to peer file-sharing programs like BitTorrent and LimeWire have been known to contain
malware, adware, and illegal downloads. Be cautious when downloading and sharing from peer-
to-peer sites.

If you have no alternative to using such sites, you should take the following precautions:

1. Use pop-up blockers.
2. Clear the cache in your computer on a regular basis.
3. Turn on “I do not want to be tracked” button when browsing the internet.

Verifying secure sites

One of the easiest ways malware, spyware, and adware can access your computer is through
downloads therefore only download from well-established sites you trust. Here are some simple
steps to help protect you from an unsafe website:

4. Never click on a link embedded in an email. Even if sent from someone you trust, always
    type the link into your browser
5. Use your common sense. Does a website look strange to you? Is it asking for sensitive
    personal information? If it looks unsafe, don’t take the risk.
6. Does the website list contact information or some signs of a real-world presence? If you
    don’t know then contact them by phone or email to establish if they are real.
7. Read the URL carefully. If this is a website you visit often, is the URL spelled correctly?
    Online criminals often set up websites almost identical to the spelling of the site you are
    trying to visit. An accidental mistype may lead you to a fraudulent version of the site.
8. Is the website offering you a product or service at an unheard-of price? Or maybe they
    are promising you a huge return on investment? If the offer looks too good to be true,
    trust your instincts. Do some research to find reviews or warnings from other users.
9. Check the properties of any links. Right clicking a hyperlink and selecting “Properties” will
    reveal the true destination of the link. Does it look different from what it claimed to lead
    you to?

Secure Websites


SSL stands for Secure Sockets Layer. SSL keeps internet connections secure and prevents criminals
from reading or modifying information transferred between two computer systems. A padlock
icon next to the URL in the address bar means SSL protects the website you are visiting.

TLS (Transport Layer Security) is an updated, more secure, version of SSL. It works in much the
same way as the SSL, using encryption to protect the transfer of data and information.

## Figure 56: The padlock symbol means the website is more secure

Activity: Use the internet to search for information and documents

1. Think about something that is important to you now or is of interest. This could be the
    physical address of a local government office, the selling price of a local food product you
    are interested in buying, or the score from a football match.
2. Select a search engine of your choice on the device of your choice.
3. Search for the document, or specific information. Your search will provide many results.
    Some of these results are useful and some are less useful. You will need to think which
    documents or information are the ones you want.

After you have completed the activity reflect and record your work.

## 16. Staying safe online: Cyber security and you


```
Staying safe online: Cyber security and you
```
```
This topic on cyber security gives information on how to ensure confidentiality,
data integrity, and how to stay safe online and offline with your digital device.
```
Expected outcomes from the cyber security module

On completion of this topic, you will be able to:

4. Make your personal information and communication safety a priority
5. Identify and resolve simple security issues
6. Test the security of online sites requiring personal information before use

What is cyber security?

Cyber security is the application of technologies, processes, and controls to protect computer
systems, networks, programs, devices and data from attacks. Digital attacks are called cyber-
attacks.

Cyber security aims to reduce the risk and severity of cyber-attacks, and to protect against the
unauthorised exploitation of systems, devices, networks and technologies. It also refers to the
practice of securing electronic devices and personal information from unauthorised access or
attack.

Cyber security includes internet governance, cybercrime, data protection, jurisdiction,
trademarks, and copyright and intellectual property.


Key Terms used in Cyber Security

Here are some definitions of terms you will come across in this manual and also in conversations
or textbooks concerning cyber security.

**Network security** is the practice of securing a computer network from intruders, whether it is by
targeted attackers or opportunistic malware or virus.

**Application security** focuses on keeping software and devices free of threats. A compromised
application could provide access to the data that it is designed to protect. Successful security
begins in the design stage, well before a program or device is deployed.

**Information security** protects the integrity and privacy of data, both in storage and in transit.

**Operational security** includes the processes and decisions for handling and protecting data assets
such as the permissions users have when accessing a network and the procedures that determine
how and where data may be stored.

**Disaster recovery and business continuity** define how an organisation responds to a cyber-
security incident or any other event that causes the loss of operations or data. The organisation
uses disaster recovery policies to dictate how it restores its operations and information to return
to the same operating capacity as before the event.

**End-user education** addresses precautions people should take to avoid accidentally introducing a
virus to a secure system by following good security practices. They teach users to delete
suspicious email attachments, not plug in unidentified USB drives, and various other important
lessons vital for the security of any organisation.

Types of Personal Data Targeted in Cyber Attacks

Personal data is any information which is related to an identified or identifiable natural person. A
person is identifiable if they can be directly or indirectly identified – for example, by reference to
an identifier such as a name, an identification number, location data, an online identifier or one of
several unique characteristics (physical, physiological, genetic, mental, commercial, cultural or
social).

Examples include your identification card number, passport number or social security number.
Other examples of personal data include the telephone number, credit card or personnel number
at workplace, accounts data, car number plate, personal appearance, customer number or
address.


Consequences of not Securing Personal Data

Most internet users are not aware of threats to online privacy and the risks associated with
having their personal data online. Here are some of the consequences of online threats to
personal data:

Financial Loss

The financial impact from a data breach is undoubtedly one of the most immediate and hard-
hitting consequences that organizations or individuals have to deal with in cybercrime.

Reputational Damage

News travels fast and organizations and individuals can find themselves at the centre of a global
news story within a matter of hours after a breach or disclosure. This negative press coupled with
a loss in trust can cause irreparable damage to the breached entity or individual in question.

Operational downtime

Business or personal operations will often be heavily disrupted in the aftermath of a data breach.
Organisations or individuals will need to contain the breach and conduct a thorough investigation
into how it occurred and what systems were accessed. The entity may need to be completely shut
down until investigators get all the answers they need and this is a process that can take days,
even weeks, depending on the severity of the breach.

Legal action

Under data protection regulations, organizations or individuals are legally bound to demonstrate
that they have taken all the necessary steps to protect personal data. If this data is compromised,
affected individuals can seek legal action to claim compensation from the responsible party.

Loss of sensitive data

Biometric data is extremely valuable to cybercriminals – much more than basic credit card
information and email addresses. This is because the criminals can use this data to cause serious
damages to the individual. Breaches that expose this data can be disastrous and exceed any
financial and reputational damage.

Threats to your personal data

Malware


Malware is malicious software such as spyware or virus. It is activated when a user clicks on a
malicious link or attachment, which leads to installing dangerous software. Once a malware is
activated, it can:

1. Block access to key network components (Ransomware)
2. Install additional harmful software
3. Covertly obtain information by transmitting data from the hard drive (Spyware)
4. Disrupt individual parts, making the system inoperable (Bricking)

You can prevent a Malware attack by talking the following steps:

**1.** Install Anti-Virus/Malware software.
**2.** Keep Your Anti-Virus Software Up to Date.
**3.** Run Regularly Scheduled Scans with Your Anti-Virus Software.
**4.** Keep Your Operating System Current.
**5.** Secure Your Network.
**6.** Avoid opening suspicious links or download attachments from unknown sources.
**7.** Keep Your Personal Information Safe by locking down all your privacy settings through
    secure passwords.
**8.** Install Firewall which prevents malicious attacks by blocking all unauthorised access to or
    from a private computer network.
**9.** Back up your data regularly and periodically test the back up to make sure you can access
    your archived information.

Phishing Attacks

This refers to gaining your personal information by tricking you. Phishing attacks are used to get
information like credit card numbers or bank login details by pretending to be a respectable
website. To prevent phishing take these simple precautions:

1. Confirm the security of a website before inputting personal information.
2. Avoid following links from emails and other messages instead, visit the target website by
    typing the address yourself into your browser.
3. Do not give out personal information online unless you are sure you can verify the
    recipient’s identity and they are trustworthy.

Spotting a Fake Email or URL


Companies and individuals are often targeted by cybercriminals through emails designed to look
like they came from a legitimate bank, government agency, or other organization. In these emails,
the sender asks recipients to click on a link that takes them to a page where they will confirm
personal data, account information, etc.

Sometimes phishing emails are coded entirely as a hyperlink. Clicking accidentally or deliberately
anywhere in the email will open a fake web page or download spam onto your computer. Avoid
links attached to emails and especially from unknown persons.

The following can help you detect if an email is real or fake:

1. The Sender’s Email Address Has a Generic Public Domain especially for a government or
    business enterprise for example:
    1. bankofbaroda@gmail.com.
    2. bankofbaroda@hotmail.com.
    3. bank_of_baroda@yahoo.com.
2. The domain name is completely wrong or slightly misspelled for example amarzon.com
    instead of amazon.com.
3. The tone of the email is urgent and requires you to act swiftly for example.
4. The email promising financial windfall or grave penalties.
5. Emails that force you to access a website.


## 17. Online abuse and cyberbullying


```
Online abuse and cyberbullying
```
```
Cyber bullying is bullying with the use of digital technologies. It can take place on
social media, messaging platforms, gaming platforms and mobile phones. It is a
repeated behaviour, aimed at scaring, angering, or shaming those who are
targeted.
```
```
Examples includes of cyber bullying are:
```
6. Spreading lies about or posting embarrassing photos of someone on social
    media.
7. Sending hurtful messages or threats via messaging platforms.
8. Impersonating someone and sending hurtful messages to others on their
    behalf.

Signs of Cyberbullying

No matter how much pain they have suffered, victims of cyberbullying are often reluctant to tell
parents, teachers, or other persons in authority about bullying because they feel a sense of shame
from being victimised. They may also fear losing their cell phone or computer privileges. Bullies
tend to be good at hiding their behaviour from those in authority. It’s important to recognise the
warning signs of cyberbullying and assist the victim to take appropriate action.

Effects of Cyberbullying

When bullying happens online, the victim can feel they are being attacked everywhere, even
inside their home. They can feel they have no escape. The effects are long lasting and affect a
person in many ways:

9. Mentally — feeling upset, embarrassed, stupid, even angry.
10. Emotionally — feeling ashamed or losing interest in the things you love.
11. Physically — tired (loss of sleep) or experiencing symptoms like stomach aches and
    headaches.

The feeling of being laughed at or harassed by others can prevent people from speaking up or
trying to deal with the problem. In extreme cases, cyber bullying can even lead to people taking
their own lives. Documented effects of cyber bullying include:

12. Higher rates of depression and anxiety.
13. Reduced feelings of self-worth.


14. Difficulties sleeping and increased bed-wetting events.
15. Higher number of physical issues such as headaches and stomach aches.
16. Increased suicide attempts (research suggests that cyber bully victims are two to nine
    times more likely to experience suicidal thoughts.
17. Increased instances of eating disorders especially among girls.
18. Truancy for young people.
19. Low levels of attainment at school.
20. Increased instances of drug and substance abuse.

Strategies for dealing with cyber bullying

Do not respond immediately

The aim of a lot of cyberbullying in most cases is to annoy, upset or confuse the person who is
being targeted, so that they react emotionally. If you are being cyber bullied, keep in mind that
the person who is targeting you wants you to respond. Do not give them the satisfaction of
knowing you are annoyed.

Follow up when you are more calm

It is important to have a good understanding of the situation before contacting the cyber bully.
Using calm, neutral language, try to resolve the situation with the person without letting them get
to you emotionally. They may not even realise that you interpreted their actions as cyber bullying,
so a calm conversation is important.

Take screenshots of the message

Screenshots are the best way to report an instance of cyber bullying. This is important because
the person bullying (the cyber bully) may delete their comment or photo when they realise that it
might get them in trouble. Screenshots will ensure you always have a copy of what was directed
at you online.

Stop frequently checking posts

You can always reduce the time you spend on social media. so that the bullying doesn’t feel
constant. Taking a break from the online world is good way to look after yourself.

Report and block

Most social media sites want to help you feel safe online, so they have a lot of built-in tools to
keep you safe and to enable you to report bullying. If you have tried using the reporting and


blocking options within your social media platform and the situation is still difficult, you can make
a report to the relevant authority in your country.

The authority in your country could be an official commissioner (such as an Information
Commissioner), a department of the government (such as a Department for Trade and
Commerce), or an office or directorate within a department. The accompanying annex for your
country will have further details relevant to you.

Specific dangers for women and girls

Over several years there has been increasing cases of young women being befriended online and
lured to remote areas where their personal safety is threatened. This has happened all over the
world and is a risk that all people should be aware of and prepared for.

Typical ways this can happen

Young women are contacted online by a person under a pretence. This can be on one of more of
these ways:

1. Posing as an old friend
2. Posing as a member of a community of interest such as a fan of a musician or band, or a
    sports team
3. Posing as a potential employer

After a period communicating with the young woman the person will ask for a meeting, a job
interview, help with a chore such as a delivery, a date or even financial help and money that
needs to be delivered.

Any of these requests should be looked at carefully.

Some suggestions to help you stay safe

The most important thing to do is verify the existence of the person you are talking to.

4. Is this a real person?
5. Are they who they say they are? For instance, is the 16-year-old girl real or is the person a
    30 - year-old man pretending to be a 16-year-old girl?
6. If the contact is from a company, is the company real, and does that person work at the
    company?
7. Always think carefully before sharing personal details about yourself online.


If you are going to a meet a person in real life that you have only ever communicated with online,
then please do at least the following:

1. Verify the person is who they say they are.
2. Check their contact details.
3. Pass their contact details to someone you trust so they can check on you.
4. Also tell this trusted person where you are going, when you are going and when you
    expect to be home, who you are going to meet with and why.
5. Meet in a well-lit public place where there are passers-by that could help you if need.
6. When you get home, don’t forget to inform your trusted person you are safe.


## 18. Understand the difference

## between real news and fake

## news


```
Understanding the difference between real news and fake news
```
```
A growing number of people use the internet to stay informed and share millions
of posts, articles, and videos across platforms such as Facebook, Twitter, and
YouTube. The rapid adoption of social media has led to a rise in information-
sharing among users, with fake news becoming a common feature of our access
to information online.. The spread of misinformation is in part attributed to a
failure by social media organisations to verify the authenticity of news items that
appear on their platforms.
```
What is real news?

Real news can be defined as legitimate news written by a professional journalist who adheres to
ethical guidelines (such as, integrity, accuracy and honesty) in gathering and writing news articles,
Real news articles report facts in a clear non-biased manner and can be verified.

What is fake news?

Fake news refers to false reports or misinformation shared in the form of articles, images, or
videos which are disguised as “real news” and aim to manipulate people’s opinions.

Fake news is spread by social media users in order to encourage other readers to discuss, repost,
and retweet these fake news stories. Fake news is mostly used to manipulate public opinion for
political or commercial gain. Fake news is easily spread – on purpose and accidentally - through
social media platforms such as Twitter, Weibo, WhatsApp, WeChat, Instagram, and Facebook.

Some real news stories, however, are labelled as fake news by influential figures in society who
might disagree on factual accuracy of articles. Examples might be when a politician is exposed for
corruption and suggests that news stories from media are fake in order to protect themselves.

Types of fake news

There are different types of fake news, depending on motives of those who create it. For
example:

1. **Clickbait** is used to get the attention of users and attract them to click through to linked
    websites and generate advertising income. Authors deliberately fabricate and exaggerate
    stories through distorted images and headlines. A typical headline might be “You won’t
    believe what the president did”, which creates a sense of curiosity in a reader who then
    clicks on the headline.
2. **Propaganda** refers to false communication in articles, written to mislead audiences. It is
    often presented to promote a political agenda or biased perspective.
3. **Targeted misinformation** is a fictitious piece of information shared for self-serving
    interests. Targeted misinformation is often directed at groups that are most susceptible


```
to receiving this type of information and easily accept and share polarizing content
without verifying its authenticity.
```
4. **Misleading headlines** can be used with real news stories. Sometimes a story may be true
    and factual, but news outlets may use a misleading or exaggerated headline to entice
    readers to click through.
5. **Imposter content** is when genuine news sources are imitated with false narratives.
    People affected by the truth can make up stories to deceive or mislead audiences from
    believing what was originally true. They can use other news outlets in order to label the
    news they disagree with as false.

Some of the ways to identify fake news

As we have seen there are many types of fake news, and there are many ways to identify fake
news. Here is some useful guidance for you:

1. Think clearly about the information you read. This means being aware of your emotional
    reactions and questioning the purpose of the story. This is a useful approach because fake
    news is created to get an emotional response e.g., anger or fear from the reader.
2. Identify the message. Is the article fair and balanced? Is the writing reasonable in the way
    it addresses an issue? Can you tell the difference between facts, opinion, assumptions,
    and misreporting?
3. Examine the evidence used in the article: A credible story uses factual evidence such as
    statistics, expert quotes, and eye-witness account from the people on the scene. You
    should also look at the images. It is easy to make fake images or alter existing images.
4. Check the source: Consider the source of a news article. News that comes from an
    unfamiliar or unknown source may be fake news. You can also check on the author or
    publisher of the news article and their reputation.
5. Check if other news outlets have published similar articles. If you can find no other report,
    then it likely the news article is false.
6. Use fact checking tools to verify the content and source of the news. Local examples of
    these tools will be found in the accompanying country annexes.

```
Taking your business online

Here are a few simple steps to consider when you are thinking about taking your business online:

1. Does your site need to be a website to help with your marketing or should it be an
    ecommerce site that can sell products and services?
    1. Service businesses use a website for marketing, that is telling a story about you
       and/or your business.
    2. Product based business might find an ecommerce website more useful. This is
       because you can have pictures, descriptions and prices of your products and you
       want to be able to sell the product through your website, and e-commerce sites
       automate your sales process.
2. Online and offline systems. Think about the processes in real life that will have to link up
    with your website. These might be arranging for sales calls or picking products and
    sending them to customers.
3. Payment processes and options. Consider payment methods that are available in your
    country and ensure that they are user friendly.
4. Think about getting your business online in small steps. Don’t try and do everything in one
    go. This can be complicated, take a long time and could be expensive.

Online and social marketing

The most important part of any business is the customer. Without people that want to buy your
product or service your business activities will not survive.


We know from this manual that the internet and the web can help us communicate in different
ways with potential customers through websites, email, and social media. We can use these
online tools to help our marketing.

Marketing is the practice of spreading messages about a brand, products or services, or a
company to potential customers. Digital, or online, marketing is the part of marketing that uses
the internet and digital technologies, digital media, and platforms to promote products and
services.

A good place to start is:

1. Have something clear you want to say. This could be a new product, or news of a sale
2. Understand who your customers are. This can be based on your existing customers, or
    new customers that you’d like to have in the future. This includes understanding what
    they want, and where they get information from online.
3. Using the websites, and social media platforms that your customers use. This means using
    Facebook, Twitter, or Instagram to get your message out. You can also use email to
    communicate with people you already know such as existing customers or people that
    used to be customers.
4. An important part of online and social marketing is thinking, listening, and responding to
    your customers. Marketing is not a one-way process. It is a form of communication, and
    this means speaking with customers and listening to customers.

Simple steps to setting up a website

1. Create a site. This will require hiring a person or paying for web creation services. Ensure
    the graphics design and artwork of the site are like that of your current business and all
    the information displayed on the website accurately reflects your current business.
2. Ensure you can support customers via email and contact forms on your website (known
    as customer relations or customer services).
3. Establish a way to communicate with your customers beyond your website by providing
    telephone and mobile phone numbers.
4. Check ease of accessibility/ usage. Make sure things like forms, chatbots, and enquiries
    email addresses are compatible with different types of digital device.
5. Finally, go through your site from the point of view of your customer. Try using the
    website the way a customer would (the customer journey). Be objective with feedback
    and use it to make your website as easy as possible to use.

Simple steps to setting up an e-commerce site


1. Product catalogue. Use existing photos of your products or have new photos taken. If you
    have a physical catalogue, you can use its descriptions, prices, and quantities for your
    online version.
2. Create the ecommerce site. Hire a web application developer who has the right skills and
    experience to create a fully functioning e-commerce site for your business.
3. Ensure your ecommerce site is a user-friendly site and can make a difference for your
    customers online.
4. Think about how you will get your products to your customers, and how they may be able
    to return products to you.
5. Have a return and refund policy that safeguards your business interest and that of the
    customer.
6. Establish payment systems that are compatible with your site and is customer friendly.
7. Provide a customer service channel for queries and complaints.
8. Set up a review option or button to get feedback from your customers.

Potential threats to online businesses and the information of their customers

If you want to take the opportunity to take your business online then you will have to think about
your own information, and the personal and financial information of your customers. Here is a
summary of some of the threats you may encounter.

Elements of Data Security for Online Business Owners

There are some fundamental aspects of data security that an online business must consider. As a
starting point consider these guiding principles of confidentiality, integrity, and availability.

1. Confidentiality - Ensures that data is accessed only by authorised users with the proper
    credentials.
2. Integrity - Ensure that all data stored is reliable, accurate, and not subject to unwarranted
    changes.
3. Availability - Ensures that data is readily and safely accessible and available for ongoing
    business needs.

SQL Injection attacks

A Structured Query Language (SQL) injection is a type of cyber-attack that results from inserting
malicious code into a server that uses SQL. When infected, the server releases information.
Submitting the malicious code can be as simple as entering it into a vulnerable website search
box.


A business can prevent SQL injection by:

1. Validating user inputs.
2. Sanitize data by limiting special characters.
3. Enforce prepared statements with parameterised queries.
4. Using stored procedures in the database.
5. Actively manage patches and updates.

Denial of Service (DoS)

This is a type of cyber-attack that floods a computer or network so that it cannot respond to
requests. Cyber attackers often use a flood attack to disrupt services and use the time that a
network is disabled to launch other attacks.

You can avoid a DoS by strengthening your business security:

6. Fortifying all internet-facing devices to prevent compromise.
7. Installing and maintaining antivirus software.
8. Establishing firewalls configured to protect against DoS attacks.
9. Following robust security practices to monitor and manage unwanted traffic.

Activity: Lesson review and first steps

10. Do you understand why you need to take your business online?
11. Are there examples of business like yours you can study or emulate?
12. Set up an online store through free online sites.

After you have completed the activity reflect and record your work.

Refer to the accompanying country annex for your country for examples of services, portals, and
exercises on accessing public, health, tax, and education services from your local and national
government.

Automated Teller Machines (ATM)

An ATM is a machine that allows bank customers to carry out banking services without the aid of
a human being.


Using an ATM allows you to withdraw money from your bank account, check bank account
balances, print a report from your bank account, deposit money and even carry out payment
transactions.

To use an ATM, you will need a debit or credit card from your bank and a PIN (Personal
Identification Number).

How to use an ATM machine

1. It is best practice to visit the appropriate ATM machine for your bank. For example, if a
    card belongs to Equity Bank look for an ATM for Equity Bank if possible. Some ATMs will
    charge you more for using a card from a different bank.
2. Basic safety at an ATM machine. ATM users are targeted by thieves and robbers. Make
    sure the ATM area is well lit. Be alert and attentive of the ATM surroundings and check
    the ATM machine for any unusual and suspicious objects.
3. Insert the ATM card into the ATM card slot with the chip side facing away from you and
    down.
4. Choose the language you want to use with the ATM.
5. Enter your secret PIN (Personal Identification Number). Make sure the numbers cannot
    be seen by anyone near you.
6. Most ATMs will let you:
    1. Withdraw money.
    2. Deposit money.
    3. Check your bank account balance.
    4. Transfer money or make payments.
7. End your session by following the instructions on the ATM machine to exit and get your
    ATM card back.
8. Take your money and the ATM card.

Important note: If your ATM card is lost, notify your bank immediately. They will help protect your
money and issue a new ATM card to you.

Activity: Using your ATM card and high-street banking services

If you have a have an ATM card you will:

1. Use it to withdraw money and deposit money.


2. Have your bank mobile banking app installed in your device and be in a position to use it
    well.
